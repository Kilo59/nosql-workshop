Docker\nClone this repo: git clone https://github.com/jbelmont/nosql-workshop.git\n\nDocker Prerequisites\nSince Docker leverages the Operating System's virtualization technologies, the install requirements for Docker are specific.\nOS X requirements:\n\n2010 or newer model with Intel's MMU virtualization\nOS X El Capitan 10.11 or newer\n\nWindows requirements:\n\n64-bit Windows\nWindows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education (not Home, not Windows 7 or 8) to install Hyper-V\nWindows 10 Anniversary Update or better\nAccess to your machine's BIOS to turn on virtualization\n\nInstall Mongo Docker Image\nPlease run the following command to pull the official mongo docker image:\ndocker pull mongo:4.0.5\nYou can also pull my own docker image which has vim installed:\ndocker pull jbelmont/mongo-vim:4.0.5\nUse the following shell script to get mongo running in your system:\n#! /bin/bash\n\ndocker run --name mongo-image-4 \\\n  --rm \\\n  -v ~/mongod_data.4.0.5:/data/db \\\n  -p 27017:27017 \\\n  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  -d mongo:4.0.5\n\nGet into mongo shell\nOnce you run the above command you should be able to get into running docker container like this in a shell session:\nmongo localhost:27017\n"},"docs/database-theory.html":{"url":"docs/database-theory.html","title":"Database Theory","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - Database Theory\nSections:\n\nDefinition of a Database\nHistory of Databases\nDatabase Classification\nDatabase Languages\nHistory of NoSQL Databases\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nDefinition of a Database\nWe can describe a database to be much like an electronic filing cabinet while the information has been digitized. The information is kept in a persistent storage mechanism such as with magnetic disks. Database users can create/insert new data into the database, change, delete, or retrieve existing information in the database by issuing commands/requests to the database system. This system is commonly called the Database Management System (DBMS).\nHistory of Databases\nPlease check out this site for Learning Computing History on Databases\nDatabase Classification\nDatabase Classification\nAll the information is from the wikipedia Page\nDifferenty Types of Databases:\n\nAn in-memory database is a database that primarily resides in main memory, but is typically backed-up by non-volatile computer data storage. Main memory databases are faster than disk databases, and so are often used where response time is critical, such as in telecommunications network equipment.\n\nAn active database includes an event-driven architecture which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database. Possible uses include security monitoring, alerting, statistics gathering and authorization. Many databases provide active database features in the form of database triggers.\n\nA cloud database relies on cloud technology. Both the database and most of its DBMS reside remotely, \"in the cloud\", while its applications are both developed by programmers and later maintained and used by end-users through a web browser and Open APIs.\n\nData warehouses archive data from operational databases and often from external sources such as market research firms. The warehouse becomes the central source of data for use by managers and other end-users who may not have access to operational data. For example, sales data might be aggregated to weekly totals and converted from internal product codes to use UPCs so that they can be compared with ACNielsen data. Some basic and essential components of data warehousing include extracting, analyzing, and mining data, transforming, loading, and managing data so as to make them available for further use.\n\nA deductive database combines logic programming with a relational database.\n\nA distributed database is one in which both the data and the DBMS span multiple computers.\n\nA document-oriented database is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or semi structured, information. Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases.\n\nAn embedded database system is a DBMS which is tightly integrated with an application software that requires access to stored data in such a way that the DBMS is hidden from the application's end-users and requires little or no ongoing maintenance.\n\nEnd-user databases consist of data developed by individual end-users. Examples of these are collections of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, multimedia, and other files. Several products exist to support such databases. Some of them are much simpler than full-fledged DBMSs, with more elementary DBMS functionality.\n\nA federated database system comprises several distinct databases, each with its own DBMS. It is handled as a single database by a federated database management system (FDBMS), which transparently integrates multiple autonomous DBMSs, possibly of different types (in which case it would also be a heterogeneous database system), and provides them with an integrated conceptual view.\n\nSometimes the term multi-database is used as a synonym to federated database, though it may refer to a less integrated (e.g., without an FDBMS and a managed integrated schema) group of databases that cooperate in a single application. In this case, typically middleware is used for distribution, which typically includes an atomic commit protocol (ACP), e.g., the two-phase commit protocol, to allow distributed (global) transactions across the participating databases.\n\nA graph database is a kind of NoSQL database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store information. General graph databases that can store any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as triplestores and network databases.\n\nAn array DBMS is a kind of NoSQL DBMS that allows modeling, storage, and retrieval of (usually large) multi-dimensional arrays such as satellite images and climate simulation output.\n\nIn a hypertext or hypermedia database, any word or a piece of text representing an object, e.g., another piece of text, an article, a picture, or a film, can be hyperlinked to that object. Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information. For example, they are useful for organizing online encyclopedias, where users can conveniently jump around the text. The World Wide Web is thus a large distributed hypertext database.\n\nA knowledge base (abbreviated KB, kb or Δ) is a special kind of database for knowledge management, providing the means for the computerized collection, organization, and retrieval of knowledge. Also a collection of data representing problems with their solutions and related experiences.\n\nA mobile database can be carried on or synchronized from a mobile computing device.\n\nOperational databases store detailed data about the operations of an organization. They typically process relatively high volumes of updates using transactions. Examples include customer databases that record contact, credit, and demographic information about a business's customers, personnel databases that hold information such as salary, benefits, skills data about employees, enterprise resource planning systems that record details about product components, parts inventory, and financial databases that keep track of the organization's money, accounting and financial dealings.\n\nA parallel database seeks to improve performance through parallelization for tasks such as loading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.\n\nThe major parallel DBMS architectures which are induced by the underlying hardware architecture are:\n\nShared memory architecture, where multiple processors share the main memory space, as well as other data storage.\n\nShared disk architecture, where each processing unit (typically consisting of multiple processors) has its own main memory, but all units share the other storage.\n\nShared nothing architecture, where each processing unit has its own main memory and other storage.\n\nProbabilistic databases employ fuzzy logic to draw inferences from imprecise data.\n\nReal-time databases process transactions fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away.\n\nA spatial database can store the data with multidimensional features. The queries on such data include location-based queries, like \"Where is the closest hotel in my area?\".\n\nA temporal database has built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of SQL. More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time.\n\nA terminology-oriented database builds upon an object-oriented database, often customized for a specific field.\n\nAn unstructured data database is intended to store in a manageable and protected way diverse objects that do not fit naturally and conveniently in common databases. It may include email messages, documents, journals, multimedia objects, etc. The name may be misleading since some objects can be highly structured. However, the entire possible object collection does not fit into a predefined structured framework. Most established DBMSs now support unstructured data in various ways, and new dedicated DBMSs are emerging.\n\n\nDatabase Languages\nAll the information is from the wikipedia Page\nDatabase Languages\n\nDatabase languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages:\n\n\nData control language (DCL) – controls access to data;\n\nData definition language (DDL) – defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping and the relationships among them;\n\nData manipulation language (DML) – performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;\n\nData query language (DQL) – allows searching for information and computing derived information.\nDatabase languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:\n\n\n\nSQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language. It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and is supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs.\nOQL is an object model language standard (from the Object Data Management Group). It has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL.\nXQuery is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as MarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and DB2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon.\nSQL/XML combines XQuery with SQL.\n\nA database language may also incorporate features like:\n\nDBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management\n\nComputations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing\n\nConstraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car)\n\nApplication programming interface version of the query language, for programmer convenience\n\n\nHistory of NoSQL Databases\nHistory of NoSQL Databases\n\nThe term NoSQL was used by Carlo Strozzi in 1998 to name his lightweight Strozzi NoSQL open-source relational database that did not expose the standard Structured Query Language (SQL) interface, but was still relational. His NoSQL RDBMS is distinct from the circa-2009 general concept of NoSQL databases. Strozzi suggests that, because the current NoSQL movement \"departs from the relational model altogether, it should therefore have been called more appropriately 'NoREL', referring to 'No Relational'.\nJohan Oskarsson, then a developer at Last.fm, reintroduced the term NoSQL in early 2009 when he organized an event to discuss \"open source distributed, non relational databases\". The name attempted to label the emergence of an increasing number of non-relational, distributed data stores, including open source clones of Google's Bigtable/MapReduce and Amazon's DynamoDB.\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← README\nData Modeling →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/data-modeling.html":{"url":"docs/data-modeling.html","title":"Data Modeling","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - Database Modeling\nSections:\n\nDefinition of Data Modeling\nData Modeling Topics\nData Modeling Process\nData Modeling Techniques Blog Post\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nAll of this information comes from Data Modeling Wikipedia Page\nDefinition of Data Modeling\n\nData modeling is a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to support the business processes within the scope of corresponding information systems in organizations. Therefore, the process of data modeling involves professional data modelers working closely with business stakeholders, as well as potential users of the information system.\nThere are three different types of data models produced while progressing from requirements to the actual database to be used for the information system. The data requirements are initially recorded as a conceptual data model which is essentially a set of technology independent specifications about the data and is used to discuss initial requirements with the business stakeholders. The conceptual model is then translated into a logical data model, which documents structures of the data that can be implemented in databases. Implementation of one conceptual data model may require multiple logical data models. The last step in data modeling is transforming the logical data model to a physical data model that organizes the data into tables, and accounts for access, performance and storage details. Data modeling defines not just data elements, but also their structures and the relationships between them.\n\nData Modeling Topics\nData Modeling Topics\n\nData models provide a framework for data to be used within information systems by providing specific definition and format. If a data model is used consistently across systems then compatibility of data can be achieved. If the same data structures are used to store and access data then different applications can share data seamlessly. The results of this are indicated in the diagram. However, systems and interfaces are often expensive to build, operate, and maintain. They may also constrain the business rather than support it. This may occur when the quality of the data models implemented in systems and interfaces is poor.\n\nData Modeling Process\n\nThe process of designing a database involves producing the previously described three types of schemas - conceptual, logical, and physical. The database design documented in these schemas are converted through a Data Definition Language, which can then be used to generate a database. A fully attributed data model contains detailed attributes (descriptions) for every entity within it. The term \"database design\" can describe many different parts of the design of an overall database system. Principally, and most correctly, it can be thought of as the logical design of the base data structures used to store the data. In the relational model these are the tables and views. In an object database the entities and relationships map directly to object classes and named relationships. However, the term \"database design\" could also be used to apply to the overall process of designing, not just the base data structures, but also the forms and queries used as part of the overall database application within the Database Management System or DBMS.\n\nEntity Relationship Diagrams\n\nThere are several notations for data modeling. The actual model is frequently called \"Entity relationship model\", because it depicts data in terms of the entities and relationships described in the data. An entity-relationship model (ERM) is an abstract conceptual representation of structured data. Entity-relationship modeling is a relational schema database modeling method, used in software engineering to produce a type of conceptual data model (or semantic data model) of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion.\nSeveral techniques have been developed for the design of data models. While these methodologies guide data modelers in their work, two different people using the same methodology will often come up with very different results.

It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as an integral part of his relational model.\nNormalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).\n\nNormalization Objectives\n\nA basic objective of the first normal form defined by Codd in 1970 was to permit data to be queried and manipulated using a \"universal data sub-language\" grounded in first-order logic. (SQL is an example of such a data sub-language, albeit one that Codd regarded as seriously flawed.)\nThe objectives of normalization beyond 1NF (first normal form) were stated as follows by Codd:\n\n\nTo free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies.\n\nTo reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations, as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life span of application programs.\n\nTo make the relational model more informative to users.\n\nTo make the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by.\n\n\nDatabase Normalization Forms\nEdgar F. Codd introduced the concept of normalization and what is now known as the first normal form (1NF) in 1970. Codd went on to define the second normal form (2NF) and third normal form (3NF) in 1971, and Codd and Raymond F. Boyce defined the Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) in 1974.\n\nInformally, a relational database relation is often described as \"normalized\" if it meets third normal form. Most 3NF relations are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.\n\nThe normal forms (from least normalized to most normalized) are:\n\nUNF: Unnormalized form\n\n1NF: First normal form\n\n2NF: Second normal form\n\n3NF: Third normal form\n\nEKNF: Elementary key normal form\n\nBCNF: Boyce–Codd normal form\n\n4NF: Fourth normal form\n\nETNF: Essential tuple normal form\n\n5NF: Fifth normal form\n\nDKNF: Domain-key normal form\n\n6NF: Sixth normal form\n\n\nPlease read the Database Normalization Wiki Post for more on normalization form details\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Database Modeling\nACID →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/acid.html":{"url":"docs/acid.html","title":"ACID","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - ACID\nSections:\n\nACID Computer Science Definition\n4 Characteristics of ACID\nImplementing ACID Properties\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nACID Computer Science Definition\nACID Computer Science Definition\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc. In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (and these can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.\n\nIn 1983, Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder coined the acronym ACID as shorthand for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, building on earlier work by Jim Gray who enumerated Atomicity, Consistency, and Durability but left out Isolation when characterizing the transaction concept. These four properties describe the major guarantees of the transaction paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems.\n\n4 Characteristics of ACID\nThe characteristics of these four properties as defined by Reuter and Härder are as follows:\nAtomicity\nAtomicity (database systems))\n\nTransactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single \"unit\", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors and crashes.\n\nConsistency\nConsistency (database systems))\n\nConsistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction, but does not guarantee that a transaction is correct.\n\nIsolation\nIsolation (database systems))\n\nTransactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., reading and writing to multiple tables at the same time). Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the method used, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to other transactions.\n\nDurability\nDurability (database systems))\n\nDurability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.\n\nImplementing ACID Properties\nImplementation ACID\n\nProcessing a transaction often requires a sequence of operations that is subject to failure for a number of reasons. For instance, the system may have no room left on its disk drives, or it may have used up its allocated CPU time. There are two popular families of techniques: write-ahead logging and shadow paging. In both cases, locks must be acquired on all information to be updated, and depending on the level of isolation, possibly on all data that may be read as well. In write ahead logging, atomicity is guaranteed by copying the original (unchanged) data to a log before changing the database. That allows the database to return to a consistent state in the event of a crash. In shadowing, updates are applied to a partial copy of the database, and the new copy is activated when the transaction commits.\n\nLocking vs Multiversioning\nLocking vs Multiversioning\n\nMany databases rely upon locking to provide ACID capabilities. Locking means that the transaction marks the data that it accesses so that the DBMS knows not to allow other transactions to modify it until the first transaction succeeds or fails. The lock must always be acquired before processing data, including data that is read but not modified. Non-trivial transactions typically require a large number of locks, resulting in substantial overhead as well as blocking other transactions. For example, if user A is running a transaction that has to read a row of data that user B wants to modify, user B must wait until user A's transaction completes. Two phase locking is often applied to guarantee full isolation.\nAn alternative to locking is multiversion concurrency control, in which the database provides each reading transaction the prior, unmodified version of data that is being modified by another active transaction. This allows readers to operate without acquiring locks, i.e., writing transactions do not block reading transactions, and readers do not block writers. Going back to the example, when user A's transaction requests data that user B is modifying, the database provides A with the version of that data that existed when user B started his transaction. User A gets a consistent view of the database even if other users are changing data. One implementation, namely snapshot isolation, relaxes the isolation property.\n\nDistributed Transactions\nDistributed Transactions#Distributed_transactions)\n\nGuaranteeing ACID properties in a distributed transaction across a distributed database, where no single node is responsible for all data affecting a transaction, presents additional complications. Network connections might fail, or one node might successfully complete its part of the transaction and then be required to roll back its changes because of a failure on another node. The two-phase commit protocol (not to be confused with two-phase locking) provides atomicity for distributed transactions to ensure that each participant in the transaction agrees on whether the transaction should be committed or not. Briefly, in the first phase, one node (the coordinator) interrogates the other nodes (the participants) and only when all reply that they are prepared does the coordinator, in the second phase, formalize the transaction.\n\nPlease read the Two-phase commit protocol Wikipedia Post\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Database Normalization\nCAP Thereom →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/cap.html":{"url":"docs/cap.html","title":"CAP Thereom","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - CAP Thereom\nSections:\n\nCAP Theorem Definition\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nCAP Theorem Definition\n\nIn theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:\n\n\nConsistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error\n\nAvailability: Every request receives a (non-error) response – without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write\n\nPartition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes\n\n\n\nIn particular, the CAP theorem implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability.

Eventual consistency, also called optimistic replication, is widely deployed in distributed systems, and has origins in early mobile computing projects. A system that has achieved eventual consistency is often said to have converged, or achieved replica convergence. Eventual consistency is a weak guarantee – most stronger models, like linearizability are trivially eventually consistent, but a system that is merely eventually consistent does not usually fulfill these stronger constraints.\nEventually-consistent services are often classified as providing BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) semantics, in contrast to traditional ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees. Eventual consistency is sometimes criticized as increasing the complexity of distributed software applications. This is partly because eventual consistency is purely a liveness guarantee (reads eventually return the same value) and does not make safety guarantees: an eventually consistent system can return any value before it converges.\n\nPlease read the Consistency Model Wikipedia Post for more in-depth information about consistency models.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← CAP Thereom\nNoSQL Databases →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/nosql-databases.html":{"url":"docs/nosql-databases.html","title":"NoSQL Databases","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - NoSQL Databases\nSections:\n\nNoSQL Definition\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nNoSQL Definition\n\nA NoSQL (originally referring to \"non SQL\" or \"non relational\") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the \"NoSQL\" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early 21st century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages, or sit alongside SQL database in a polyglot persistence architecture.\nMotivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler \"horizontal\" scaling to clusters of machines (which is a problem for relational databases), and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as \"more flexible\" than relational database tables.\nMany NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of the CAP theorem) in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed. Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of low-level query languages (instead of SQL, for instance the lack of ability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables), lack of standardized interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational databases. Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions, although a few databases have made them central to their designs.\nInstead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of \"eventual consistency\" in which database changes are propagated to all nodes \"eventually\" (typically within milliseconds) so queries for data might not return updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not accurate, a problem known as stale reads. Additionally, some NoSQL systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms of data loss. Some NoSQL systems provide concepts such as write-ahead logging to avoid data loss. For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases, data consistency is an even bigger challenge that is difficult for both NoSQL and relational databases. Even current relational databases \"do not allow referential integrity constraints to span databases.\" Few systems maintain both ACID transactions and X/Open XA standards for distributed transaction processing.\n\nPlease checkout NoSQL White Papers on MongoDB White Papers Site\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Eventual Consistency\nTypes of NoSQL Databases →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/types-of-nosql-databases.html":{"url":"docs/types-of-nosql-databases.html","title":"Types of NoSQL Databases","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - Types of NoSQL Databases\nSections:\n\nTypes of NoSQL Databases\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nTypes of NoSQL Databases\nThere are 4 main types of NoSQL Databases:\n\nKey-Value\n\nA key-value store has a Big Hash Table of keys & values \nExamples: Riak, Amazon S3 (Dynamo), Aerospike\n\n\nDocument\n\nDocument databases store documents made up of tagged elements. \nExamples: CouchDB, MongoDb, RethinkDB, Couchbase\n\n\nColumn\n\nIn a column database, a storage block contains data from only one column.\nExamples: Cassandra, Scylla, Druid, HBase, Vertica\n\n\nGraph\n\nA graph database is a network database that uses edges and nodes to represent and store data. \nExamples: AllegroGraph, ArangoDB, InfiniteGraph, Apache Giraph, MarkLogic, Neo4J, OrientDB, Virtuoso\n\n\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← NoSQL Databases\nKey-Value Database →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/key-value-database.html":{"url":"docs/key-value-database.html","title":"Key-Value Database","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - Key-Value Database\nSections:\n\nDefinition of a Key-Value Database\nList of Key-Value Databases\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nKey-Value Database Wikipedia Post\nDefinition of a Key-Value Database\n\nA key-value database, or key-value store, is a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash table. Dictionaries contain a collection of objects, or records, which in turn have many different fields within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to quickly find the data within the database.\nKey-value databases work in a very different fashion from the better known relational databases (RDB). RDBs pre-define the data structure in the database as a series of tables containing fields with well defined data types. Exposing the data types to the database program allows it to apply a number of optimizations. In contrast, key-value systems treat the data as a single opaque collection, which may have different fields for every record. This offers considerable flexibility and more closely follows modern concepts like object-oriented programming. Because optional values are not represented by placeholders or input parameters, as in most RDBs, key-value databases often use far less memory to store the same database, which can lead to large performance gains in certain workloads.[citation needed]\nPerformance, a lack of standardization and other issues limited key-value systems to niche uses for many years, but the rapid move to cloud computing after 2010 has led to a renaissance as part of the broader NoSQL movement.

XML databases are a subclass of document-oriented databases that are optimized to work with XML documents. Graph databases are similar, but add another layer, the relationship, which allows them to link documents for rapid traversal.\nDocument-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the key-value store, another NoSQL database concept. The difference lies in the way the data is processed; in a key-value store, the data is considered to be inherently opaque to the database, whereas a document-oriented system relies on internal structure in the document in order to extract metadata that the database engine uses for further optimization. Although the difference is often moot due to tools in the systems, conceptually the document-store is designed to offer a richer experience with modern programming techniques.\nDocument databases contrast strongly with the traditional relational database (RDB). Relational databases generally store data in separate tables that are defined by the programmer, and a single object may be spread across several tables. Document databases store all information for a given object in a single instance in the database, and every stored object can be different from every other. This eliminates the need for object-relational mapping while loading data into the database.\nThe central concept of a document-oriented database is the notion of a document. While each document-oriented database implementation differs on the details of this definition, in general, they all assume documents encapsulate and encode data (or information) in some standard format or encoding. Encodings in use include XML, YAML, JSON, and BSON, as well as binary forms like PDF and Microsoft Office documents (MS Word, Excel, and so on).\n\nDocuments in a document store are roughly equivalent to the programming concept of an object. They are not required to adhere to a standard schema, nor will they have all the same sections, slots, parts or keys. Generally, programs using objects have many different types of objects, and those objects often have many optional fields. Every object, even those of the same class, can look very different. Document stores are similar in that they allow different types of documents in a single store, allow the fields within them to be optional, and often allow them to be encoded using different encoding systems. For example, the following is a document, encoded in JSON:\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5c7b07e38a0730edba859aef\"),\n    \"name\" : \"Sue\",\n    \"age\" : 26,\n    \"status\" : \"pending\"\n}\nCRUD Operations\n\nThe core operations that a document-oriented database supports for documents are similar to other databases, and while the terminology is not perfectly standardized, most practitioners will recognize them as CRUD:\n\n\nCreation (or insertion)\nRetrieval (or query, search, read or find)\nUpdate (or edit)\nDeletion (or removal)\n\nList of Document Databases\nPlease check out the following Wikipedia Table on Document Databases\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Column Database\nGraph Database →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/graph-database.html":{"url":"docs/graph-database.html","title":"Graph Database","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - Graph Database\nSections:\n\nDefinition of a Graph Database\nGraphs in Computer Science\nList of Graph Databases\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nDefinition of a Graph Database\n\nIn computing, a graph database (GDB) is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship), which directly relates data items in the store a collection of nodes of data and edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships within a graph database is fast because they are perpetually stored within the database itself. Relationships can be intuitively visualized using graph databases, making it useful for heavily inter-connected data.\nGraph databases are part of the NoSQL databases created to address the limitations of the existing relational databases. While the graph model explicitly lays out the dependencies between nodes of data, the relational model and other NoSQL database models link the data by implicit connections. Graph databases, by design, allow simple and fast retrieval[citation needed] of complex hierarchical structures that are difficult to model[according to whom?] in relational systems. Graph databases are similar to 1970s network model databases in that both represent general graphs, but network-model databases operate at a lower level of abstraction and lack easy traversal over a chain of edges.\nThe underlying storage mechanism of graph databases can vary. Some depend on a relational engine and “store” the graph data in a table (although a table is a logical element, therefore this approach imposes another level of abstraction between the graph database, the graph database management system and the physical devices where the data is actually stored). Others use a key-value store or document-oriented database for storage, making them inherently NoSQL structures. Most[according to whom?] graph databases based on non-relational storage engines also add the concept of tags or properties, which are essentially relationships having a pointer to another document. This allows data elements to be categorized for easy retrieval en masse.\nRetrieving data from a graph database requires a query language other than SQL, which was designed for the manipulation of data in a relational system and therefore cannot “elegantly” handle traversing a graph. As of 2017, no single graph query language has been universally adopted in the same way as SQL was for relational databases, and there are a wide variety of systems, most often tightly tied to one product. Some standardization efforts have occurred, leading to multi-vendor query languages like Gremlin, SPARQL, and Cypher. In addition to having query language interfaces, some graph databases are accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs).\nGraph databases differ from graph compute engines. Graph databases are technologies that are translations of the relational OLTP databases. On the other hand, graph compute engines are utilized in OLAP for bulk analysis. Graph databases have attracted considerable attention in the 2000s, due to the successes of major technology corporations in using proprietary graph databases, and the introduction of open-source graph databases.\n\nGraphs in Computer Science\nPlease check out the Wikipedia post on Graphs\nList of Graph Databases\nPlease check out the following Wikipedia Table on Graph Databases\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Document Database\nMongoDB →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/mongodb.html":{"url":"docs/mongodb.html","title":"MongoDB","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - MongoDB\nSections:\n\nWhat is MongoDB\nMongoDB Features\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nWhat is MongoDB\n\nMongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).\n\nMongoDB Features\nAd hoc queries\n\nMongoDB supports field, range query, and regular expression searches. Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions. Queries can also be configured to return a random sample of results of a given size.\n\nIndexing\n\nFields in a MongoDB document can be indexed with primary and secondary indices.\n\nReplication\n\nMongoDB provides high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data. Each replica set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time. All writes and reads are done on the primary replica by default. Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically conducts an election process to determine which secondary should become the primary. Secondaries can optionally serve read operations, but that data is only eventually consistent by default.\n\nLoad balancing\n\nMongoDB scales horizontally using sharding. The user chooses a shard key, which determines how the data in a collection will be distributed. The data is split into ranges (based on the shard key) and distributed across multiple shards. (A shard is a master with one or more replicas.). Alternatively, the shard key can be hashed to map to a shard – enabling an even data distribution.\nMongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load or duplicating data to keep the system up and running in case of hardware failure.\n\nFile storage\n\nMongoDB can be used as a file system, called GridFS, with load balancing and data replication features over multiple machines for storing files.\nThis function, called grid file system, is included with MongoDB drivers. MongoDB exposes functions for file manipulation and content to developers. GridFS can be accessed using mongofiles utility or plugins for Nginx and lighttpd. GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, and stores each of those chunks as a separate document.\n\nAggregation\n\nMongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods.\nMap-reduce can be used for batch processing of data and aggregation operations. But according to MongoDB's documentation, the Aggregation Pipeline provides better performance for most aggregation operations.\nThe aggregation framework enables users to obtain the kind of results for which the SQL GROUP BY clause is used. Aggregation operators can be strung together to form a pipeline – analogous to Unix pipes. The aggregation framework includes the $lookup operator which can join documents from multiple documents, as well as statistical operators such as standard deviation.\n\nServer-side JavaScript execution\n\nJavaScript can be used in queries, aggregation functions (such as MapReduce), and sent directly to the database to be executed.\n\nCapped collections\n\nMongoDB supports fixed-size collections called capped collections. This type of collection maintains insertion order and, once the specified size has been reached, behaves like a circular queue.\n\nTransactions\n\nSupport for multi-document ACID transactions was added to MongoDB with the General Availability of the 4.0 release in June 2018.\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Graph Database\nBSON Specification →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/bson-specification.html":{"url":"docs/bson-specification.html","title":"BSON Specification","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - BSON Specification\nSections:\n\nGeneral Description\nBasic Types\nNon-terminals\nNotes Section\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nAll Information gleaned from official bson specification\nGeneral Description\n\nBSON is a binary format in which zero or more ordered key/value pairs are stored as a single entity.

Note that quoted strings represent terminals, and should be interpreted with C semantics (e.g. \"\\x01\" represents the byte 0000 0001). Also note that we use the  operator as shorthand for repetition (e.g. (\"\\x01\"2) is \"\\x01\\x01\").

The $type aggregation operator returns the type of an operator expression using one of the listed BSON type strings.\n\nWe can check the type using the mongo shell like this:\n\nObjectId\nObjectId\n\nObjectIds are small, likely unique, fast to generate, and ordered. ObjectId values consist of 12 bytes, where the first four bytes are a timestamp that reflect the ObjectId’s creation. Specifically:\n\n\na 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch,\na 5-byte random value, and\na 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.\n\n\nIn MongoDB, each document stored in a collection requires a unique _id field that acts as a primary key. If an inserted document omits the _id field, the MongoDB driver automatically generates an ObjectId for the _id field.\n\nThis also applies to documents inserted through update operations with upsert: true.\nMongoDB clients should add an _id field with a unique ObjectId. \nUsing ObjectIds for the _id field provides the following additional benefits:\n\nin the mongo shell, you can access the creation time of the ObjectId, using the ObjectId.getTimestamp() method.\n\nsorting on an _id field that stores ObjectId values is roughly equivalent to sorting by creation time.\n\n\nString\nString\n\nBSON strings are UTF-8. In general, drivers for each programming language convert from the language’s string format to UTF-8 when serializing and deserializing BSON. This makes it possible to store most international characters in BSON strings with ease. In addition, MongoDB $regex queries support UTF-8 in the regex string.\n\nTimestamps\nTimestamps\n\nBSON has a special timestamp type for internal MongoDB use and is not associated with the regular Date type.

This results in a representable date range of about 290 million years into the past and future.\nThe official BSON specification refers to the BSON Date type as the UTC datetime.\n\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← BSON Specification\nMongo Shell →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/mongo-shell.html":{"url":"docs/mongo-shell.html","title":"Mongo Shell","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop -

You can assign the database reference to a variable other than db.\nWrite operations in the mongo shell use a write concern of { w: 1 } by default. If performing bulk operations, use the Bulk() methods. See Write Method Acknowledgements for more information.\nYou cannot use any shell helper (e.g. use , show dbs, etc.) inside the JavaScript file because they are not valid JavaScript.\n\nThe following table maps the most common mongo shell helpers to their JavaScript equivalents.\n\n\n\nShell Helpers\nJavaScript Equivalents\n\n\n\n\nshow dbs, show databases\ndb.adminCommand('listDatabases')\n\n\nuse \ndb = db.getSiblingDB('')\n\n\nshow collections\ndb.getCollectionNames()\n\n\nshow users\ndb.getUsers()\n\n\nshow roles\ndb.getRoles({showBuiltinRoles: true})\n\n\nshow log \ndb.adminCommand({ 'getLog' : '' })\n\n\nshow logs\ndb.adminCommand({ 'getLog' : '*' })\n\n\nit\ncursor = db.collection.find() if ( cursor.hasNext() ){cursor.next(); }\n\n\n\n\nIn interactive mode, mongo prints the results of operations including the content of all cursors. In scripts, either use the JavaScript print() function or the mongo specific printjson() function which returns formatted JSON.\nTo print all items in a result cursor in mongo shell scripts, use the following idiom:\n\ncursor = db.numbers.find();\nwhile ( cursor.hasNext() ) {\n   printjson( cursor.next() );\n}\n\nScripting\nFrom the system prompt, use mongo to evaluate JavaScript.\n\nNotice that the screenshot show the collections that exist on the localhost/nosql_workshop connection on port 27017.\nExecuting a Javascript file on the mongo shell\nYou can specify a .js file to the mongo shell, and mongo will execute the JavaScript directly. Consider the following example:\n\n\nAlternately, you can specify the mongodb connection parameters inside of the javascript file using the Mongo() constructor.\n\nYou can execute a .js file from within the mongo shell, using the load() function.\nload(\"scripts/show_collections.js\")\n\nshow_collections script:\n\ninventory,json,numbers,people\ntrue\n\nHere is the contents of the show_collections.js script:\n\"use strict\";\n\n// equivalent for \"use \" command in mongo shell\nvar db = db.getSiblingDB('nosql_workshop');\n\n// print the collections present in nosql_workshop db\nprint(\"\\nshow_collections script:\\n\")\nprint(db.getCollectionNames());\n\n\nThe load() method accepts relative and absolute paths.\nThere is no search path for the load() function. If the desired script is not in the current working directory or the full specified path, mongo will not be able to access the file.\n\nData Types in the mongo Shell\n\nMongoDB BSON provides support for additional data types than JSON. Drivers provide native support for these data types in host languages and the mongo shell also provides several helper classes to support the use of these data types in the mongo JavaScript shell. \n\nThe mongo shell provides various methods to return the date, either as a string or as a Date object:\n\nDate()\n\nmethod which returns the current date as a string.\nnew Date() constructor which returns a Date object using the ISODate() wrapper.\n\n\nISODate() \n\nconstructor which returns a Date object using the ISODate() wrapper.\n\n\n\nTypes\nDates\n\nInternally, Date objects are stored as a signed 64-bit integer representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970).\n\nHere is a shell session using Date and ISODate:\n\nObjectIds\nThe mongo shell provides the ObjectId() wrapper class around the ObjectId data type. To generate a new ObjectId, use the following operation in the mongo shell.\nReturns a new ObjectId value. The 12-byte ObjectId value consists of:\na 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch,\na 5-byte random value, and\na 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.\n> new ObjectId()\nObjectId(\"5c68614d90753389f07190a9\")\n\nNumberLong\nThe mongo shell treats all numbers as floating-point values by default. The mongo shell provides the NumberLong() wrapper to handle 64-bit integers.\nThe NumberLong() wrapper accepts the long as a string:\n> NumberLong(\"2090845886855\")\nNumberLong(\"2090845886855\")\n\nHere is an example session with NumberLong:\n> db.numbers.insertOne( { _id: 6, calc: NumberLong(\"2090845886852\") } )\n{ \"acknowledged\" : true, \"insertedId\" : 6 }\n> db.numbers.updateOne( { _id: 6 },\n...                       { $set:  { calc: NumberLong(\"2555555000000\") } } )\n{ \"acknowledged\" : true, \"matchedCount\" : 1, \"modifiedCount\" : 1 }\n> db.numbers.updateOne( { _id: 6 },\n...                       { $inc: { calc: NumberLong(5) } } )\n{ \"acknowledged\" : true, \"matchedCount\" : 1, \"modifiedCount\" : 1 }\n> db.numbers.find({\n... \"_id\": 6\n... }).pretty()\n{ \"_id\" : 6, \"calc\" : NumberLong(\"2555555000005\") }\n\nNumberInt\nThe mongo shell treats all numbers as floating-point values by default. The mongo shell provides the NumberInt() constructor to explicitly specify 32-bit integers.\nHere is an example session:\n> NumberInt(100)\nNumberInt(100)\n> NumberInt(1.5)\nNumberInt(1)\n\nNotice how NumberInt(1.5) got casted into 32-bit integer.\nNumberDecimal\nNew in version 3.4.\nThe mongo shell treats all numbers as 64-bit floating-point double values by default. The mongo shell provides the NumberDecimal() constructor to explicitly specify 128-bit decimal-based floating-point values capable of emulating decimal rounding with exact precision. This functionality is intended for applications that handle monetary data, such as financial, tax, and scientific computations.\nThe decimal BSON type uses the IEEE 754 decimal128 floating-point numbering format which supports 34 decimal digits (i.e. significant digits) and an exponent range of −6143 to +6144.\nThe NumberDecimal() constructor accepts the decimal value as a string:\n\nThe NumberDecimal() constructor also accepts double values from the mongo shell (i.e. without quotes), although this is not recommended due to the risk of losing precision. The constructor creates a binary-based double precision representation of the decimal-based parameter (potentially losing precision), then converts that value to a decimal value with a precision of 15 digits. The following example passes the value implicitly as a double and shows how it is created with a precision of 15 digits:\n\nHere is an example session:\n> NumberDecimal(1000.55)\nNumberDecimal(\"1000.55000000000\")\n\nNotice the loss in precision here.\nEquality and Sort Order\nHere is an example session showing equality and sort order:\n> db.numbers2.insertMany([\n... { \"_id\" : 1, \"val\" : NumberDecimal( \"9.99\" ), \"description\" : \"Decimal\" },\n... { \"_id\" : 2, \"val\" : 9.99, \"description\" : \"Double\" },\n... { \"_id\" : 3, \"val\" : 10, \"description\" : \"Double\" },\n... { \"_id\" : 4, \"val\" : NumberLong(10), \"description\" : \"Long\" },\n... { \"_id\" : 5, \"val\" : NumberDecimal( \"10.0\" ), \"description\" : \"Decimal\" }\n... ])\n{ \"acknowledged\" : true, \"insertedIds\" : [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] }\n> db.numbers2.find({})\n{ \"_id\" : 1, \"val\" : NumberDecimal(\"9.99\"), \"description\" : \"Decimal\" }\n{ \"_id\" : 2, \"val\" : 9.99, \"description\" : \"Double\" }\n{ \"_id\" : 3, \"val\" : 10, \"description\" : \"Double\" }\n{ \"_id\" : 4, \"val\" : NumberLong(10), \"description\" : \"Long\" }\n{ \"_id\" : 5, \"val\" : NumberDecimal(\"10.0\"), \"description\" : \"Decimal\" }\n> db.numbers2.find({\n... val: 9.99\n... })\n{ \"_id\" : 2, \"val\" : 9.99, \"description\" : \"Double\" }\n\n\nThe first query, { \"val\": 9.99 }, implicitly searches for the double representation of 9.99 which is not equal to the decimal representation of the value.\n\nChecking for decimal type\nTo test for decimal type, use the $type operator with the string alias \"decimal\" or 19, the numeric code for the decimal type.\n> db.inventory.insertOne({\n...     \"_id\": new ObjectId(),\n...     \"item\" : \"postcard\",\n...     \"qty\" : 60,\n...     \"status\" : \"A\",\n...     \"size\" : {\n...         \"h\" : 10,\n...         \"w\" : NumberDecimal(\"15.25\"),\n...         \"uom\" : \"cm\" },\n...         \"tags\" : [     \"blue\" ]\n...     }\n... )\n{\n    \"acknowledged\" : true,\n    \"insertedId\" : ObjectId(\"5c6865d8035949476a06ce05\")\n}\n> db.inventory.find({\n... \"size.w\": {\n... \"$type\": \"decimal\"\n... }})\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5c68656090753389f07190aa\"),\n    \"item\" : \"postcard\",\n    \"qty\" : 59,\n    \"status\" : \"A\",\n    \"size\" : {\n        \"h\" : 10,\n        \"w\" : NumberDecimal(\"15.25\"),\n        \"uom\" : \"cm\"\n    },\n    \"tags\" : [\n        \"blue\"\n    ]\n}\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5c6865d8035949476a06ce05\"),\n    \"item\" : \"postcard\",\n    \"qty\" : 60,\n    \"status\" : \"A\",\n    \"size\" : {\n        \"h\" : 10,\n        \"w\" : NumberDecimal(\"15.25\"),\n        \"uom\" : \"cm\"\n    },\n    \"tags\" : [\n        \"blue\"\n    ]\n}\n\nCheck Types in the mongo Shell\nTo determine the type of fields, the mongo shell provides the instanceof and typeof operators.\ninstanceof\ninstanceof returns a boolean to test if a value is an instance of some type.\nLet us look at an example in the mongo shell:\n> db.inventory.find({ \"size.w\": {  \"$type\": \"decimal\" }})[0]._id instanceof ObjectId\ntrue\n\ntypeof\ntypeof returns the type of a field.\nLet us look at the type of the _id field in the shell:\n> typeof db.inventory.find({ \"size.w\": {  \"$type\": \"decimal\" }})[0]._id\nobject\n\nIn this case typeof will return the more generic object type rather than ObjectId type.\nMongo Shell Quick Reference\nmongo Shell Command History\n\nYou can retrieve previous commands issued in the mongo shell with the up and down arrow keys. Command history is stored in ~/.dbshell file.\n\nCommand Line Options\nThe mongo shell can be started with numerous options.\nThe following table displays some common options for mongo:\n\n\n\nCommand Line Option\nCommand Line Description\n\n\n\n\n--help\nShow command line options\n\n\n--nodb\nStart mongo shell without connecting to a database.

MongoDB provides the following methods to update documents of a collection:\n\ndb.collection.updateOne()\n\ndb.collection.updateMany()\n\ndb.collection.replaceOne()\n\n\nLet us look at an example in the mongo shell:\n\nDelete Operations\nDelete operations remove documents from a collection. MongoDB provides the following methods to delete documents of a collection:\n\ndb.collection.deleteOne()\n\ndb.collection.deleteMany()\n\n\nIn MongoDB, delete operations target a single collection. All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.\nYou can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to remove. These filters use the same syntax as read operations.\nLet us look at some examples in the mongo shell:\n\nNotice that deleteMany deleted more than one document.\nBulk Write\nMongoDB provides the ability to perform write operations in bulk.\nInsert Documents\nInsert Documents\nIf the collection does not currently exist, insert operations will create the collection.\n\ndb.collection.insertMany() can insert multiple documents into a collection. \nPass an array of documents to the method.\n\nNotice in the screenshot above that we created arrays in the mongo shell and then passed the numbers array into the insertMany collection method.\nAlso notice that the insertMany() method returns a document that includes the newly inserted documents _id field values.\nAll write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.\nInsert Methods in mongodb\n\nNotice that in this screenshot we use insertOne to insert one document and insertMany to insert an array of documents.\n\nNotice that here we were able to pass an array into the insert() method as well like we did in the insertMany() method.\n\nNotice that in this screenshot we used an options object with a field of upsert: true to create a document that it did not exist already.\nYou can use the upsert option with the other write methods to create a document as well:\n\ndb.collection.updateOne()\ndb.collection.updateMany()\ndb.collection.findAndModify()\ndb.collection.findOneAndUpdate()\ndb.collection.findOneAndReplace()\ndb.collection.save()\ndb.collection.bulkWrite()\n\nQuery Documents\nThe most common method to query documents in mongodb is the find() method.\nSelect All Documents in a Collection\nWe can select all the documents in the numbers collection with the following query:\ndb.numbers.find({})\n\nThis command is the equivalent to the following SQL command: SELECT * FROM numbers\nSpecify Equality Condition\nYou can pass in a query object to specify an equality condition in mongodb.\n\nNotice that we only got back the number documents that match this query.\nSpecify AND Conditions\n\nNotice that here we specified an additional condition here and in SQL this would be the equivalent query:\nSELECT * FROM numbers WHERE type = \"Decimal\" AND value > 4.5\n\nSpecify OR Conditions\n\nNotice that in this query we specified an or condition and in SQL this would be the equivalent query:\nSELECT * FROM numbers WHERE type = \"Dont know\" OR \"val\" = 19.8\n\nSpecify AND and OR Conditions\ndb.inventory.find( {\n     status: \"A\",\n     $or: [ { qty: { $lt: 30 } }, { item: /^p/ } ]\n} )\n\nThis query will check the status of A and use the or condition of whether qty is less than 30 or item field starts with p\nIn SQL this would be the equivalent query:\nSELECT * FROM inventory WHERE status = \"A\" AND ( qty \nMongoDB supports regular expressions $regex queries to perform string pattern matches.\nCursor\nCursor\n\nThe db.collection.find() method returns a cursor to the matching documents.\n\nAdditional Read Methods\ndb.collection.findOne read method:\n\nMatch an Embedded/Nested Document\nTo specify an equality condition on a field that is an embedded/nested document, use the query filter document \n{ :  } where  is the document to match.\n\nEquality matches on the whole embedded document require an exact match of the specified  document, including the field order. \n\nFor example, the following query does not match any documents in the inventory collection.\nNotice this behavior in the screenshot below:\n\nQuery on Nested Field\nYou must place nested field queries in double quotes. \nNotice this behavior in the screenshot below:\n\nSpecify Match using Query Operator\nA query filter document can use the query operators to specify conditions in the following form:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n$eq\nMatches values that are equal to a specified value.\n\n\n$gt\nMatches values that are greater than a specified value.\n\n\n$gte\nMatches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.\n\n\n$in\nMatches any of the values specified in an array.\n\n\n$lt\nMatches values that are less than a specified value.\n\n\n$lte\nMatches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.\n\n\n$ne\nMatches all values that are not equal to a specified value.\n\n\n$nin\nMatches none of the values specified in an array.\n\n\n\nLook at the screenshot below for an example using $gt query operator in action:\n\nWe can even chain query operators with an AND condition as the screenshot below demonstrates:\n\nMatch an array\nMatch Array\nTo specify equality condition on an array, use the query document { >:  } \nwhere  is the exact array to match, including the order of the elements.\nIf you don't use the $all query operator then the equality match in the array must match the order and value.\nLook at the screenshot below for an illustration:\n\nQuery an array for a particular element\nYou can query an array for a particular element by doing:\n{ >:  } \nLook at the screenshot below:\n\nQuery an Array with Compound Filter Conditions on the Array Elements\n\nThe following example queries for documents where the dim_cm array contains elements that in some combination satisfy the query conditions; e.g., one element can satisfy the greater than 15 condition and another element can satisfy the less than 20 condition, or a single element can satisfy both:\n\n\nQuery for an Array Element that Meets Multiple Criteria\n\nUse $elemMatch operator to specify multiple criteria on the elements of an array such that at least one array element satisfies all the specified criteria.\n\nThe following example queries for documents where the dim_cm array contains at least one element that is both greater than ($gt) 22 and less than ($lt) 30:\ndb.inventory.find({ dim_cm: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 22, $lt: 30 } } })\n\nQuery for an Element by the Array Index Position\n\nUsing dot notation, you can specify query conditions for an element at a particular index or position of the array. \nThe array uses zero-based indexing.\n\nLook at the screenshot below for an example of this:\n\nQuery an Array by Array Length\n\nUse the $size operator to query for arrays by number of elements. \n\nFor example, the following selects documents where the array tags has 3 elements.\n\nQuery an Array of Embedded Documents\nQuery for a Document Nested in an Array\n\nThe following example selects all documents where an element in the instock array matches the specified document:\n\n\n\nEquality matches on the whole embedded/nested document require an exact match of the specified document, including the field order. For example, the following query does not match any documents in the inventory collection:\n\nSo you can't do something like this:\n> db.inventory.find( { \"instock\": { warehouse: \"B\", qty: { $gt: 30 } } } )\n\nsince the nested document that would work has the following structure:\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"5c7af040746b1d79ff96c8e5\"),\n    \"item\" : \"planner\",\n    \"instock\" : [\n        {\n            \"warehouse\" : \"A\",\n            \"qty\" : 40\n        },\n        {\n            \"warehouse\" : \"B\",\n            \"qty\" : 5\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nNotice how instock has 2 documents where one is greater than 30 but another is less than 30\nSpecify a Query Condition on a Field in an Array of Documents\n\nIf you do not know the index position of the document nested in the array, concatenate the name of the array field, with a dot (.) and the name of the field in the nested document.\nThe following example selects all documents where the instock array has at least one embedded document that contains the field qty whose value is less than or equal to 20:\n\ndb.inventory.find( { 'instock.qty': { $lte: 20 } } )\n\nA Single Nested Document Meets Multiple Query Conditions on Nested Fields\n\nUse $elemMatch operator to specify multiple criteria on an array of embedded documents such that at least one embedded document satisfies all the specified criteria.\nThe following example queries for documents where the instock array has at least one embedded document that contains both the field qty equal to 5 and the field warehouse equal to A:\n\ndb.inventory.find( { \"instock\": { $elemMatch: { qty: 5, warehouse: \"A\" } } } )\n\n\nThe following example queries for documents where the instock array has at least one embedded document that contains the field qty that is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 20:\n\ndb.inventory.find( { \"instock\": { $elemMatch: { qty: { $gt: 10, $lte: 20 } } } } )\n\nCombination of Elements Satisfies the Criteria\n\nIf the compound query conditions on an array field do not use the $elemMatch operator, the query selects those documents whose array contains any combination of elements that satisfies the conditions.\nFor example, the following query matches documents where any document nested in the instock array has the qty field greater than 10 and any document (but not necessarily the same embedded document) in the array has the qty field less than or equal to 20:\n\ndb.inventory.find( { \"instock.qty\": { $gt: 10,  $lte: 20 } } )\n\n\nThe following example queries for documents where the instock array has at least one embedded document that contains the field qty equal to 5 and at least one embedded document (but not necessarily the same embedded document) that contains the field warehouse equal to A:\n\ndb.inventory.find( { \"instock.qty\": 5, \"instock.warehouse\": \"A\" } )\n\nProject Fields to Return from Query\n\nBy default, queries in MongoDB return all fields in matching documents. \n\nTo limit the amount of data that MongoDB sends to applications, you can include a projection document to specify or restrict fields to return.\nReturn All Fields in Matching Documents\nIf you do not specify a projection document then mongodb will return all fields in a document by default.\n\nThe operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:\nSELECT * from inventory WHERE status = \"A\"\n\nReturn the Specified Fields and the _id Field Only\nProject Fields from Query Result\n\nA projection can explicitly include several fields by setting the  to 1 in the projection document. \n\nThe following operation returns all documents that match the query. \n\nIn the result set, only the item, status and, by default, the _id fields return in the matching documents.\n\n\nSuppress _id Field\nYou can remove the _id field from the results by setting it to 0 in the projection, as in the following example:\ndb.inventory.find( { status: \"A\" }, { item: 1, status: 1, _id: 0 } )\n\n\nThe operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:\n\nSELECT item, status from inventory WHERE status = \"A\"\n\nReturn All But the Excluded Fields\nReturn All But the Excluded Fields\n\nInstead of listing the fields to return in the matching document, you can use a projection to exclude specific fields. The following example which returns all fields except for the status and the instock fields in the matching documents:\n\ndb.inventory.find( { status: \"A\" }, { status: 0, instock: 0 } )\n\nWith the exception of the _id field, you cannot combine inclusion and exclusion statements in projection documents.\nReturn Specific Fields in Embedded Documents\nYou can return specific fields in an embedded document. \nUse the dot notation to refer to the embedded field and set to 1 in the projection document.\nIn the screenshot below we return the fields: _id, qty, status, and \"size.h\":\n\nSuppress Specific Fields in Embedded Documents\nYou can suppress specific fields in an embedded document. \nUse the dot notation to refer to the embedded field in the projection document and set to 0.\nIn the screenshot below we return neither the _id field nor the \"size.h\" fields:\n\nProjection on Embedded Documents in an Array\n\nUse dot notation to project specific fields inside documents embedded in an array.\n\nIn the screenshot below we return only the \"instock.warehouse\" nested document:\n\nProject Specific Array Elements in the Returned Array\n\nFor fields that contain arrays, MongoDB provides the following projection operators for manipulating arrays: $elemMatch, $slice, and $.\nThe following example uses the $slice projection operator to return the last element in the instock array but also checks that the instock array exists:\n\n\nQuery for Null or Missing Fields\nEquality Filter\nThe { item : null } query matches documents that either contain the item field whose value is null or that do not contain the item field.\n\nType Check\n\nThe { item : { $type: 10 } } query matches only documents that contain the item field whose value is null; i.e. the value of the item field is of BSON Type Null (type number 10) :\n\n\nThe query returns only the document where the item field has a value of null.\nExistence Check\n\nThe { item : { $exists: false } } query matches documents that do not contain the item field:\n\n\nIterate a Cursor in the mongo Shell\n\nThe db.collection.find() method returns a cursor. To access the documents, you need to iterate the cursor. However, in the mongo shell, if the returned cursor is not assigned to a variable using the var keyword, then the cursor is automatically iterated up to 20 times to print up to the first 20 documents in the results.\n\nManually Iterate the Cursor\nIn the mongo shell, when you assign the cursor returned from the find() method to a variable using the var keyword, the cursor does not automatically iterate.\n\nYou can also use the cursor method next() to access the documents, as in the following example:\n\nUpdate Documents\n\n\n\nUpdate Method\nDescription\nVersion Available\n\n\n\n\ndb.collection.updateOne()\nUpdates at most a single document that match a specified filter even though multiple documents may match the specified filter.\nNew in version 3.2.\n\n\ndb.collection.updateMany()\nUpdate all documents that match a specified filter.\nNew in version 3.2.\n\n\ndb.collection.replaceOne()\nReplaces at most a single document that match a specified filter even though multiple documents may match the specified filter.\nNew in version 3.2.\n\n\ndb.collection.update()\nEither updates or replaces a single document that match a specified filter or updates all documents that match a specified filter. By default, the db.collection.update() method updates a single document. To update multiple documents, use the multi option.\nExisting\n\n\n\nLet us add a series of documents to the inventory collection:\ndb.inventory.insertMany( [\n   { item: \"canvas\", qty: 100, size: { h: 28, w: 35.5, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n   { item: \"journal\", qty: 25, size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n   { item: \"mat\", qty: 85, size: { h: 27.9, w: 35.5, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n   { item: \"mousepad\", qty: 25, size: { h: 19, w: 22.85, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"P\" },\n   { item: \"notebook\", qty: 50, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: \"in\" }, status: \"P\" },\n   { item: \"paper\", qty: 100, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: \"in\" }, status: \"D\" },\n   { item: \"planner\", qty: 75, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"D\" },\n   { item: \"postcard\", qty: 45, size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n   { item: \"sketchbook\", qty: 80, size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n   { item: \"sketch pad\", qty: 95, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30.5, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" }\n] );\n\nUpdate a Single Document\nUpdate a single document\nThe following example uses the db.collection.updateOne() method on the inventory collection to update the first document where item equals \"paper\":\n\nThe update operation:\n\nuses the $set operator to update the value of the size.uom field to \"cm\" and the value of the status field to \"P\"\n\nuses the $currentDate operator to update the value of the lastModified field to the current date. \n\nIf lastModified field does not exist, $currentDate will create the field. See $currentDate for details.\n\n\n\nUpdate Multiple Documents\nThe following example uses the db.collection.updateMany() method on the inventory collection to update all documents where qty is less than 50:\n\nThe update operation:\n\nuses the $set operator to update the value of the size.uom field to \"in\" and the value of the status field to \"P\"\n\nuses the $currentDate operator to update the value of the lastModified field to the current date. \n\nIf lastModified field does not exist, $currentDate will create the field. See $currentDate for details.\n\n\n\nReplace a Document\nTo replace the entire content of a document except for the _id field, pass an entirely new document as the second argument to db.collection.replaceOne().\nWhen replacing a document, the replacement document must consist of only field/value pairs; i.e. do not include update operators expressions.\nThe replacement document can have different fields from the original document. In the replacement document, you can omit the _id field since the _id field is immutable; however, if you do include the _id field, it must have the same value as the current value.\nThe following example replaces the first document from the inventory collection where item: \"paper\":\n\nWrite behavior in mongodb\nAll write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.\n_id Field\nOnce set, you cannot update the value of the _id field nor can you replace an existing document with a replacement document that has a different _id field value.\nDelete Documents\nLet us insert many documents that will be deleted in inventory collection:\ndb.inventory.insertMany( [\n   { item: \"journal\", qty: 25, size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n   { item: \"notebook\", qty: 50, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: \"in\" }, status: \"P\" },\n   { item: \"paper\", qty: 100, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: \"in\" }, status: \"D\" },\n   { item: \"planner\", qty: 75, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"D\" },\n   { item: \"postcard\", qty: 45, size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n] );\n\nDelete All Documents\nRemove Documents\n\n\n\nDelete Method\nDescription\nVersion Available\n\n\n\n\ndb.collection.deleteOne()\nDelete at most a single document that match a specified filter even though multiple documents may match the specified filter.\nNew in version 3.2.\n\n\ndb.collection.deleteMany()\nDelete all documents that match a specified filter.\nNew in version 3.2.\n\n\ndb.collection.remove()\nDelete a single document or all documents that match a specified filter.\nAvailable in Early versions of mongodb.\n\n\n\nTo delete all documents from a collection, pass an empty filter document {} to the db.collection.deleteMany() method.\nThe following example deletes all documents from the inventory collection:\n\nThe method returns a document with the status of the operation. For more information and examples, see deleteMany().\nLet us reinsert inventory documents:\ndb.inventory.insertMany( [\n   { item: \"journal\", qty: 25, size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n   { item: \"notebook\", qty: 50, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: \"in\" }, status: \"P\" },\n   { item: \"paper\", qty: 100, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: \"in\" }, status: \"D\" },\n   { item: \"planner\", qty: 75, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"D\" },\n   { item: \"postcard\", qty: 45, size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: \"cm\" }, status: \"A\" },\n] );\n\nDelete All Documents that Match a Condition\nYou can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to delete. \nThe filters use the same syntax as read operations.\nTo specify equality conditions, use : expressions in the query filter document:\n{ : , ... }\nA query filter document can use the query operators to specify conditions in the following form:\n{ : { :  }, ... }\nTo delete all documents that match a deletion criteria, pass a filter parameter to the deleteMany() method.\nThe following example removes all documents from the inventory collection where the status field equals \"A\":\n\nThe method returns a document with the status of the operation.\nDelete Only One Document that Matches a Condition\nTo delete at most a single document that matches a specified filter (even though multiple documents may match the specified filter) use the db.collection.deleteOne() method.\nThe following example deletes the first document where status is \"D\":\ndb.inventory.deleteOne( { status: \"D\" } )\n\nDelete Behavior\nDelete Behavior\nDelete operations do not drop indexes, even if deleting all documents from a collection.\n\nAll write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.

Bulk write operations affect a single collection. MongoDB allows applications to determine the acceptable level of acknowledgement required for bulk write operations.\n\nOverview\n\nThe db.collection.bulkWrite() method provides the ability to perform bulk insert, update, and remove operations. MongoDB also supports bulk insert through the db.collection.insertMany().\n\nOrdered vs Unordered Operations\n\nBulk write operations can be either ordered or unordered.\nWith an ordered list of operations, MongoDB executes the operations serially. If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write operations, MongoDB will return without processing any remaining write operations in the list.\nWith an unordered list of operations, MongoDB can execute the operations in parallel, but this behavior is not guaranteed. If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write operations, MongoDB will continue to process remaining write operations in the list.\nExecuting an ordered list of operations on a sharded collection will generally be slower than executing an unordered list since with an ordered list, each operation must wait for the previous operation to finish.\n\nBy default, bulkWrite() performs ordered operations. To specify unordered write operations, set ordered : false in the options document.\nbulkWrite() Methods\nbulkwrite methods\nbulkWrite() supports the following write operations:\n\ninsertOne\nupdateOne\nupdateMany\nreplaceOne\ndeleteOne\ndeleteMany\n\nEach write operation is passed to bulkWrite() as a document in an array.\nFor example, the following performs multiple write operations:\nLet us run the following script in the mongo shell:\n\"use strict\";\n\ndb = connect(\"localhost:27017/nosql_workshop\");\n\ntry {\n    db.characters.bulkWrite(\n       [\n          { insertOne :\n             {\n                \"document\" :\n                {\n                   \"_id\" : 4, \"char\" : \"Dithras\", \"class\" : \"barbarian\", \"lvl\" : 4\n                }\n             }\n          },\n          { insertOne :\n             {\n                \"document\" :\n                {\n                   \"_id\" : 5, \"char\" : \"Taeln\", \"class\" : \"fighter\", \"lvl\" : 3\n                }\n             }\n          },\n          { updateOne :\n             {\n                \"filter\" : { \"char\" : \"Eldon\" },\n                \"update\" : { $set : { \"status\" : \"Critical Injury\" } }\n             }\n          },\n          { deleteOne :\n             { \"filter\" : { \"char\" : \"Brisbane\"} }\n          },\n          { replaceOne :\n             {\n                \"filter\" : { \"char\" : \"Meldane\" },\n                \"replacement\" : { \"char\" : \"Tanys\", \"class\" : \"oracle\", \"lvl\" : 4 }\n             }\n          }\n       ]\n    );\n } catch (e) {\n    print(e);\n }\n\nIn a mongo shell session and assuming that you are in the nosql-workshop folder run the following command:\n\nSince we ran this script in the mongo shell you won't see what happened but here is a summary:\n{\n   \"acknowledged\" : true,\n   \"deletedCount\" : 1,\n   \"insertedCount\" : 2,\n   \"matchedCount\" : 2,\n   \"upsertedCount\" : 0,\n   \"insertedIds\" : {\n      \"0\" : 4,\n      \"1\" : 5\n   },\n   \"upsertedIds\" : {\n\n   }\n}\n\nSQL to MongoDB Mapping Chart\nTerminology and Concepts\nThe following table presents the various SQL terminology and concepts and the corresponding MongoDB terminology and concepts.\n\n\n\nSQL\nTerms/Concepts    MongoDB Terms/Concepts\n\n\n\n\ndatabase\ndatabase\n\n\ntable\ncollection\n\n\nrow\ndocument or BSON document\n\n\ncolumn\nfield\n\n\nindex\nindex\n\n\ntable joins\n$lookup, embedded documents\n\n\nprimary key => Specify any unique column or column combination as primary key.\nprimary key => In MongoDB, the primary key is automatically set to the _id field.\n\n\naggregation (e.g. group by)\naggregation pipeline => See the SQL to Aggregation Mapping Chart\n\n\ntransactions\ntransactions\n\n\n\nExecutables\nExecutables\n\nThe following table presents some database executables and the corresponding MongoDB executables.

AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    user_id Varchar(30),\n    age Number,\n    status char(1),\n    PRIMARY KEY (id)\n)\n\nMongoDB Schema Statements\ndb.people.insertOne({\n    user_id: \"abc123\",\n    age: 55,\n    status: \"A\"\n})\n\nNotice that in the screenshot below that mongodb implicitly created the _id field for us:\n\nWe can also directly create a new collection like this:\ndb.createCollection(\"people2\")\n{ \"ok\" : 1 }\n\nALTER TABLE people\nADD join_date DATETIME\n\n\nCollections do not describe or enforce the structure of its documents; i.e. there is no structural alteration at the collection level.\nHowever, at the document level, updateMany() operations can add fields to existing documents using the $set operator.\n\nNotice that in the screenshot below we modified 51 documents and set a new field of join_date\nimages/mongo-set\nALTER TABLE people\nDROP COLUMN join_date\n\n\nCollections do not describe or enforce the structure of its documents; i.e. there is no structural alteration at the collection level.\nHowever, at the document level, updateMany() operations can remove fields from documents using the $unset operator.\n\nNotice in the screenshot below that we removed the join_date field from multiple documents:\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_user_id_asc\nON people(user_id)\n\nWe can create indexes in mongodb like this:\ndb.people.createIndex( { user_id: 1 } )\nHere is the ack document response:\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_user_id_asc_age_desc\nON people(user_id, age DESC)\n\nWe can also create multiple indexes as well:\ndb.people.createIndex( { user_id: 1, age: -1 } )\nDROP TABLE people\n\ndb.people2.drop()\ntrue\n\nMongoDB Insert vs SQL Insert\nINSERT INTO people(user_id, age, status)\nVALUES (\"bcd001\", 45, \"A\")\n\n\nSQL SELECT vs MongoDB Select find\nSELECT *\nFROM people\n\n\nNotice in the screenshot above that the query returns everything!\nSELECT id, user_id, status\nFROM people\n\n\nNotice that here we utilize mongo projections to get only certain fields!\nSELECT user_id, status\nFROM people\n\n\nNotice that in the screenshot above that the default _id field was not returned!\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE status = \"A\"\n\nThis sql example uses the where clause condition:\n\nSELECT user_id, status\nFROM people\nWHERE status = \"A\"\n\n\nNotice that here we use a filter condition and projection.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE status != \"A\"\n\nHere we use negation sql example\n\nNotice that in this screenshot we create a new document with a status of 'B' and then our query finds one result with the $ne operator.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE status = \"A\"\nAND age = 50\n\n\nNotice that in the screenshot above we just add another key/value pair for the and operation.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE status = \"A\"\nOR age = 50\n\n\nNotice that we specify the $or operator and our search will either return a status of 'A' or age = 50\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE age > 25\n\nHere our sql query is for any person with age greater than 25\ndb.people.find(\n    { age: { $gt: 25 } }\n)\n\nHere we use the $gt operator to find any persons greater than 25 in our query document.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE age \nHere our sql query looks for any person who is less than 25.\ndb.people.find(\n   { age: { $lt: 25 } }\n)\n\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE age > 25\nAND   age \nIn this sql query we look for any person who is older than 25 but no older than 50 years old.\ndb.people.find(\n   { age: { $gt: 25, $lte: 50 } }\n)\n\nNotice here that we just add the $gt and $lte operators to do the same query in mongodb.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE user_id like \"%bc%\"\n\nIn this sql query we look for any user_id that has the letters bc in them such as abc bc12 and so on.\n\nNotice here that we use a regex pattern delineated by // in the screenshot above.\n\nNotice that here we directly use the $regex operator.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE user_id like \"bc%\"\n\nIn this sql query we look for any user_id that begin with bc such as bc123 and so on.\n\nNotice in the screenshot above that we look only get one document back.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE status = \"A\"\nORDER BY user_id ASC\n\nIn this sql query we look for people with a status of A and then sort the results back in ascending order by user_id.\n\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE status = \"A\"\nORDER BY user_id DESC\n\n\nNotice that in this screenshot we got 2 documents with user_id at the top ordered in descending order.\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM people\n\nIn this sql query we get the total count of people in the people table.\n\nNotice that we can get the count by calling count directly on the people collection or by finding all the documents and then calling the count method in mongodb.\nSELECT COUNT(user_id)\nFROM people\n\nIn this sql query we get the total count of people with a user_id field.\n\nNotice that we use a filter query document checking for the existence of the user_id field and pass that to the count method or we can pass this query filter document to the find method and then call count.\nThis is because the method db.collection.count:\nfunction (query, options) {\n    query = this.find(query);\n\n    // Apply options and return the result of the find\n    return QueryHelpers._applyCountOptions(query, options).count(true);\n}\n\nNotice that under the hood the count method calls the query method as well!\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM people\nWHERE age > 30\n\nIn this sql query we get the count of all people who are over the age of 30.\n\nNotice that in this screenshot we utilize the $gt operator in the find query document or in the count method.\nSELECT DISTINCT(status)\nFROM people\n\nIn this sql query we get only retrieve distinct status values from the people table.\n\nHere we call the aggregate method and either use the $group operator or we can call the distinct method.\ndb.collection.aggregate:\nfunction (pipeline, aggregateOptions) {\n    if (!(pipeline instanceof Array)) {\n        // Support legacy varargs form. Also handles db.foo.aggregate().\n        pipeline = Array.from(arguments);\n        aggregateOptions = {};\n    } else if (aggregateOptions === undefined) {\n        aggregateOptions = {};\n    }\n\n    const cmdObj = this._makeCommand(\"aggregate\", {pipeline: pipeline});\n\n    return this._db._runAggregate(cmdObj, aggregateOptions);\n}\n\nNotice that the aggregate method will turn the pipeline into an array.\ndb.people.distinct:\nfunction (keyString, query, options) {\n    var opts = Object.extend({}, options || {});\n    var keyStringType = typeof keyString;\n    var queryType = typeof query;\n\n    if (keyStringType != \"string\") {\n        throw new Error(\"The first argument to the distinct command must be a string but was a \" +\n                        keyStringType);\n    }\n\n    if (query != null && queryType != \"object\") {\n        throw new Error(\"The query argument to the distinct command must be a document but was a \" +\n                        queryType);\n    }\n\n    // Distinct command\n    var cmd = {distinct: this.getName(), key: keyString, query: query || {}};\n\n    // Set maxTimeMS if provided\n    if (opts.maxTimeMS) {\n        cmd.maxTimeMS = opts.maxTimeMS;\n    }\n\n    if (opts.collation) {\n        cmd.collation = opts.collation;\n    }\n\n    // Execute distinct command\n    var res = this.runReadCommand(cmd);\n    if (!res.ok) {\n        throw _getErrorWithCode(res, \"distinct failed: \" + tojson(res));\n    }\n\n    return res.values;\n}\n\nNotice that distinct is the key we pass into it.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nLIMIT 1\n\nIn this sql query we select all fields from the people table and only return one result.\n\nHere we have 2 ways to return one result, we can call .findOne or call the limit method and pass one.\nSELECT *\nFROM people\nLIMIT 5\nSKIP 10\n\nIn this sql query we select all rows in the people table and return 5 results and skip the first 10.\n> db.people.find().limit(5)\n{\n    \"_id\" :

it skips the first 10 documents in mongodb.\ndb.collection.find().skip() definition:\nfunction (skip) {\n    this._checkModify();\n    this._skip = skip;\n    return this;\n}\n\nThe method definition of the skip method.\nEXPLAIN SELECT *\nFROM people\nWHERE status = \"A\"\n\nThe EXPLAIN keyword is used throughout various SQL databases and provides information about how your SQL database executes a query. \nIn MySQL and in PostgresSQL:\n\nEXPLAIN can be used in front of a query beginning with SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, REPLACE, and UPDATE.\n\nSo in the sql query above we are getting the query execution plan for the select query.\n\nSQL Update vs Mongo Update\nUPDATE people\nSET status = \"C\"\nWHERE age > 25\n\nIn this sql query we update all people that have status of \"C\" and whose age > 25\n\nHere we set all the mongoDB documents for all the people who are over the age of 25 and set the status to \"C\".\nUPDATE people\nSET age = age + 3\nWHERE status = \"A\"\n\nIn this sql query we increment the age by 3 for people whose status is \"A\"\n\nHere we increment only one person age by 3.\nSQL Delete vs Mongo Delete\nDELETE FROM people\nWHERE status = \"D\"\n\nIn this sql query we delete all people whose status is \"D\"\n\nIn the screenshot above we insert 2 new documents in the people collection and then remove the new documents by passing in a filter in the delete method.\nDELETE FROM people\n\nIn this sql query we delete all the people from the people table.\n\nNotice in the screenshot that we deleted every document in the people collection so be careful using deleteMany and pass a filter query or if you know what you are doing then execute it.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Mongo CRUD Operations\nMongo CRUD Operations Part III

  });\n});\n\nRemember to run the script from the root of the github repository and run it like this:\nmongo scripts/create-stores-collection.js\n\nYou should have 50 store documents in the stores collection now which you can confirm with the following query:\ndb.stores.count()\n50\n\nText Index\nText Index\n\nMongoDB provides text indexes to support text search queries on string content. Text indexes can include any field whose value is a string or an array of string elements.\nTo perform text search queries, you must have a text index on your collection. A collection can only have one text search index, but that index can cover multiple fields.\n\n\n\nNotice that the stores collection already had an index. \n\nEach MongoDB collection has a default index on the _id field by default. \n\nSo that is why we now have 2 indexes on the stores collection.\n\n\n$text operator\nText Operator\nNow that we have created a text index with the previous mongoDB command we can actually use the text index by using the $text query operator to perform text searches on a collection with a text index.\n\n$text will tokenize the search string using whitespace and most punctuation as delimiters, and perform a logical OR of all such tokens in the search string.\n\n\nNotice that here we use the $text operator and the $search operator\nWe get only one search result with the text search of \"multimedia\".\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n$search\nstring\nA string of terms that MongoDB parses and uses to query the text index. MongoDB performs a logical OR search of the terms unless specified as a phrase. See Behavior for more information on the field.\n\n\n$language\nstring\nOptional. The language that determines the list of stop words for the search and the rules for the stemmer and tokenizer. If not specified, the search uses the default language of the index. For supported languages, see Text Search Languages. If you specify a language value of \"none\", then the text search uses simple tokenization with no list of stop words and no stemming.\n\n\n$caseSensitive\nboolean\nOptional. A boolean flag to enable or disable case sensitive search. Defaults to false; i.e. the search defers to the case insensitivity of the text index. For more information, see Case Insensitivity. New in version 3.2.\n\n\n$diacriticSensitive\nboolean\nOptional. A boolean flag to enable or disable diacritic sensitive search against version 3 text indexes. Defaults to false; i.e. the search defers to the diacritic insensitivity of the text index. Text searches against earlier versions of the text index are inherently diacritic sensitive and cannot be diacritic insensitive. As such, the $diacriticSensitive option has no effect with earlier versions of the text index. For more information, see Diacritic Insensitivity. New in version 3.2.\n\n\n\nNotice that the $search operator does a logical OR search let us look at this in detail in the following screenshot:\n\nNotice that we inserted 4 new documents into the stores collection and then we searched for \"Brewing\", and \"Tasting\" and only got 1 result but when we searched for \"Tasting\" and \"Brewery\" in the $search text we got 2 documents back.\nExact Phrase Mongo Text Search\nExact Phrase\n\nYou can also search for exact phrases by wrapping them in double-quotes. If the $search string includes a phrase and individual terms, text search will only match documents that include the phrase.\n\nRemember that you must escape the double quotes in order to include them as part of the search.\n\nNotice here that we wrapped the text in double quotes and we got an exact search for just a company that does \"Tasting\" and \"Brewery\".\nTerm Exclusion in Mongo Text Search\nTerm Exclusion\n\nTo exclude a word, you can prepend a \"-\" character. \n\n\nNotice here that we 2 results and in our term exclusion we explicitly told MongoDB to exclude any search result with the word \"stable\".\n# Sorting in Mongo Text Search\nSorting\n\nMongoDB will return its results in unsorted order by default. However, text search queries will compute a relevance score for each document that specifies how well a document matches the query.\n\nTo sort the results in order of relevance score, you must explicitly project the $meta textScore field and sort on it:\n\n\n\nKeyword\nDescription\nSort Order\n\n\n\n\n\"textScore\"\nReturns the score associated with the corresponding $text query for each matching document. The text score signifies how well the document matched the search term or terms. If not used in conjunction with a $text query, returns a score of 0.\nDescending\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we get a score of 1 for the document with \"description\" : \"interactive\" as it is matched exactly while \"description\" : \"Brewery Distillery\" and \"description\" : \"Tasting Brewery\" documents both got a score of 0.75 for a close match but not an exact match.\nText search is also available in the aggregation pipeline.\nText Search in the Aggregation Pipeline\nText Search in the Aggregation Pipeline\n\nIn the aggregation pipeline, text search is available via the use of the $text query operator in the $match stage.\n\nRestrictions\n\ntext search in the aggregation pipeline has the following restrictions in addition to $text operator restrictions:\n\n\nThe $match stage that includes a $text must be the first stage in the pipeline.\nA text operator can only occur once in the stage.\nThe text operator expression cannot appear in $or or $not expressions.\nThe text search, by default, does not return the matching documents in order of matching scores. * Use the $meta aggregation expression in the $sort stage.\n\nLet us create a new collection with the following mongo script:\n\"use strict\";\n\nlet db = connect(\"localhost:27017/nosql_workshop\");\n\nlet articles = [{\"text\":\"Abshire LLC\",\"title\":\"Intuitive system-worthy conglomeration\"},{\"text\":\"Murphy LLC\",\"title\":\"Programmable grid-enabled methodology\"},{\"text\":\"Torp, Block and Effertz\",\"title\":\"Progressive foreground benchmark\"},{\"text\":\"Mraz, Wunsch and McClure\",\"title\":\"Operative attitude-oriented application\"},{\"text\":\"Kemmer, Murphy and Boyer\",\"title\":\"Re-engineered demand-driven orchestration\"},{\"text\":\"Zieme, Weimann and Barton\",\"title\":\"Advanced didactic pricing structure\"},{\"text\":\"Nader LLC\",\"title\":\"Multi-lateral regional groupware\"},{\"text\":\"Lakin, Kshlerin and Fritsch\",\"title\":\"Synergized mission-critical firmware\"},{\"text\":\"Durgan -

Although the index can support $nearSphere queries that calculate on a sphere, if possible, use the 2dsphere index for spherical queries.\nTo create a 2d index, use the db.collection.createIndex() method, specifying the location field as the key and the string literal \"2d\" as the index type:\ndb.collection.createIndex( {  : \"2d\" } )\nGeospatial Indexes and Sharded Collections\n\nYou cannot use a geospatial index as a shard key when sharding a collection. However, you can create a geospatial index on a sharded collection by using a different field as the shard key.\n\nGeospatial Queries\nGeospatial Query Operators:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n$geoIntersects\nSelects geometries that intersect with a GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere index supports $geoIntersects.\n\n\n$geoWithin\nSelects geometries within a bounding GeoJSON geometry. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $geoWithin.\n\n\n$near\nReturns geospatial objects in proximity to a point. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $near.\n\n\n$nearSphere\nReturns geospatial objects in proximity to a point on a sphere. Requires a geospatial index. The 2dsphere and 2d indexes support $nearSphere.\n\n\n\nGeospatial Command\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngeoNear (Deprecated in MongoDB 4.0)\nPerforms a geospatial query that returns the documents closest to a given point. The deprecated geoNear command requires a geospatial index.\n\n\n\nGeospatial Aggregation Stage\n\n\n\nStage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n$geoNear\nReturns an ordered stream of documents based on the proximity to a geospatial point. Incorporates the functionality of $match, $sort, and $limit for geospatial data. The output documents include an additional distance field and can include a location identifier field.  $geoNear requires a geospatial index.\n\n\n\nGeospatial Models\n\nMongoDB geospatial queries can interpret geometry on a flat surface or a sphere.\n2dsphere indexes support only spherical queries (i.e. queries that interpret geometries on a spherical surface).\n2d indexes support flat queries (i.e. queries that interpret geometries on a flat surface) and some spherical queries. While 2d indexes support some spherical queries, the use of 2d indexes for these spherical queries can result in error. If possible, use 2dsphere indexes for spherical queries.\n\nGeoSpatial Query Examples\nLet us populate a new mongodb collection called geospatial with some geospatial data:\nPlease run the following mongo script in the root of the repository:\nmongo scripts/create-geospatial-collection.js\n\nFind Restaurants with Geospatial Queries\nLet us use the datasets provided by Geospatial Tutorial in MongoDB Site\nI have added the 2 datasets in the datasets directory in the root of the repository.\nPlease make sure that mongo is running by running the following script:\nsh scripts/run-mongo-shell.sh\n\nNext to import the 2 datasets run the following commands:\n\nNotice that we should have 2 new collections in the nosql_workshop database now.\nNow run the following mongo script to create indexes for the new collections:\nmongo scripts/create-restaurants-neighborhoods-indexes.js\n\nNow let us look at one particular document in the restaurants collection:\n> db.restaurants.findOne()\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55cba2476c522cafdb053ae4\"),\n    \"location\" : {\n        \"coordinates\" : [\n            -74.00528899999999,\n            40.628886\n        ],\n        \"type\" : \"Point\"\n    },\n    \"name\" : \"Regina Caterers\"\n}\n\nNow let us look at one particular document in the restaurants collection:\ndb.neighborhoods.findOne()\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55cb9c666c522cafdb053a1b\"),\n    \"geometry\" : {\n        \"coordinates\" : [\n            [\n                [\n                    -73.94732672160579,\n                    40.62916656720943\n                ],\n                .......................\n                [\n                    -73.94732672160579,\n                    40.62916656720943\n                ]\n            ]\n        ],\n        \"type\" : \"Polygon\"\n    },\n    \"name\" : \"Midwood\"\n}\n\nFind the Current Neighborhood\nAssuming the user’s mobile device can give a reasonably accurate location for the user, it is simple to find the user’s current neighborhood with $geoIntersects.\n\nSuppose the user is located at -73.93414657 longitude and 40.82302903 latitude. To find the current neighborhood, you will specify a point using the special $geometry field in GeoJSON format:\n\n\n\nThis query will tell you that there are 127 restaurants in the requested neighborhood, visualized in the following figure:\n\nFind all restaurants in the neighborhood Mongo Picture\nFind Restaurants within a Distance\nTo find restaurants within a specified distance of a point, you can use either $geoWithin with $centerSphere to return results in unsorted order, or nearSphere with $maxDistance if you need results sorted by distance.\nUnsorted with $geoWithin\nTo find restaurants within a circular region, use $geoWithin with $centerSphere. $centerSphere is a MongoDB-specific syntax to denote a circular region by specifying the center and the radius in radians.\n$geoWithin does not return the documents in any specific order, so it may show the user the furthest documents first.\nThe following will find all restaurants within five miles of the user:\ndb.restaurants.find({ location:\n   { $geoWithin:\n      { $centerSphere: [ [ -73.93414657, 40.82302903 ], 5 / 3963.2 ] } } })\n\nSorted with $nearSphere\nYou may also use $nearSphere and specify a $maxDistance term in meters.

This prevents insertions or updates from creating duplicate data. Create a unique index on multiple fields to force uniqueness on that combination of field values. For examples of use cases, see update() and Unique Index and findAndModify() and Unique Index.\n\nRead Isolation, Consistency, and Recency\nPlease read the offical docs at Read Isolation Consistency Recency\nDistributed Queries\nPlease read the official docs at Distributed Queries\nLinearizable Reads via findAndModify\nPlease run the following script to populate products collection:\nmongo scripts/create-products-collection.js\n\nPerform Findandmodify Linearizable Reads\n\nUse the db.collection.findAndModify() method to make a trivial update to the document you want to read and return the modified document. A write concern of { w: \"majority\" } is required. To specify the document to read, you must use an exact match query that is supported by a unique index.\n\n\n\nThe following findAndModify() operation specifies an exact match on the uniquely indexed field sku and increments the field named _dummy_field in the matching document. While not necessary, the write concern for this command also includes a wtimeout value of 5000 milliseconds to prevent the operation from blocking forever if the write cannot propagate to a majority of voting members.\nEven in situations where two nodes in the replica set believe that they are the primary, only one will be able to complete the write with w: \"majority\".

Mongo Aggregations\nSections:\n\nAggregation Pipeline\nMap-Reduce\nAggregation Reference\nSQL to Aggregation Mapping Chart\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nAll of this information is gathered from the official mongodb docs in https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/\n\nAggregation operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function, and single purpose aggregation methods.\n\nAggregation Pipeline\nAggregation Pipeline\n\nMongoDB’s aggregation framework is modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result.\nThe most basic pipeline stages provide filters that operate like queries and document transformations that modify the form of the output document.\nOther pipeline operations provide tools for grouping and sorting documents by specific field or fields as well as tools for aggregating the contents of arrays, including arrays of documents. In addition, pipeline stages can use operators for tasks such as calculating the average or concatenating a string.\nThe pipeline provides efficient data aggregation using native operations within MongoDB, and is the preferred method for data aggregation in MongoDB.\nThe aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into aggregated results.\n\n\nNotice that here we just received all of the matching 10 documents since cust_id is unique in each record.\nLet us create a couple of documents with same id now and try again:\ndb.orders.aggregate([\n...     { $match: { status: \"A\" } },\n...     { $group: { _id: \"$cust_id\", total: { $sum: \"$amount\" } } }\n... ])\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000091797795367\", \"total\" : 892.95 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000030934189763\", \"total\" : 72.03 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000061184481622\", \"total\" : 406.77 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000017100593284\", \"total\" : 939.15 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000032394277703\", \"total\" : 446.45 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000068199381696\", \"total\" : 737.54 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000002686460521\", \"total\" : 580.83 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000076848558193\", \"total\" : 274.04 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000015417137497\", \"total\" : 685.98 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000021996040483\", \"total\" : 252.43 }\n> db.orders.insertMany([\n... { _id: new ObjectId(), cust_id: \"1000015417137497\", amount: 50.25, status: \"A\" },\n... { _id: new ObjectId(), cust_id: \"1000015417137497\", amount: 25.75, status: \"A\" },\n... { _id: new ObjectId(), cust_id: \"1000015417137497\", amount: 75.25, status: \"A\" }\n... ])\n{\n    \"acknowledged\" : true,\n    \"insertedIds\" : [\n        ObjectId(\"5c9bafc5f65647b492473840\"),\n        ObjectId(\"5c9bafc5f65647b492473841\"),\n        ObjectId(\"5c9bafc5f65647b492473842\")\n    ]\n}\n> db.orders.aggregate([\n... { $match: { status: \"A\" } },\n... { $group: { _id: \"$cust_id\", total: { $sum: \"$amount\" } } }\n... ])\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000091797795367\", \"total\" : 892.95 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000030934189763\", \"total\" : 72.03 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000061184481622\", \"total\" : 406.77 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000017100593284\", \"total\" : 939.15 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000032394277703\", \"total\" : 446.45 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000068199381696\", \"total\" : 737.54 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000002686460521\", \"total\" : 580.83 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000076848558193\", \"total\" : 274.04 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000015417137497\", \"total\" : 837.23 }\n{ \"_id\" : \"1000021996040483\", \"total\" : 252.43 }\n>\n\nWe added 2 more documents for the $cust_id of \"1000015417137497\" and now we should get a different total for the 4 documents in total.\nNotice that now we have an aggregation for the $cust_id of \"1000015417137497\" and a different total and we can compute this total manually to verify as:\n685.98 + 50.25 + 25.75 + 75.25 = 837.23\nMongoDB Aggregation with Zipcode dataset\nZipcode Dataset MongoDB\nPlease run the following mongoimport command to import the zipcode dataset:\nmongoimport datasets/zips.json -c zipcodes -d nosql_workshop\n\n\nReturn States with Populations above 10 Million\nReturn States with Populations above 10 Million\nLet us run an aggregation query that returns state that have populations > 10 million:\n\nHere is a breakdown according to MongoDB docs!\n\nThe $group stage groups the documents of the zipcode collection by the state field, calculates the totalPop field for each state, and outputs a document for each unique state.\nThe new per-state documents have two fields: the _id field and the totalPop field. The _id field contains the value of the state; i.e. the group by field. The totalPop field is a calculated field that contains the total population of each state. To calculate the value, $group uses the $sum operator to add the population field (pop) for each state.\nThe $match stage filters these grouped documents to output only those documents whose totalPop value is greater than or equal to 10 million. The $match stage does not alter the matching documents but outputs the matching documents unmodified.\n\nHere is an equivalent SQL statement according to the docs:\nSELECT state, SUM(pop) AS totalPop\nFROM zipcodes\nGROUP BY state\nHAVING totalPop >= (10*1000*1000)\n\nReturn Average City Population by State\nReturn Average City Population by State\n\nThe following aggregation operation returns the average populations for cities in each state:\n\n\n\nIn this example, the aggregation pipeline consists of the $group stage followed by another $group stage:\n\n\nThe first $group stage groups the documents by the combination of city and state, uses the $sum expression to calculate the population for each combination, and outputs a document for each city and state combination.\n\nA second $group stage groups the documents in the pipeline by the _id.state field (i.e. the state field inside the _id document), uses the $avg expression to calculate the average city population (avgCityPop) for each state, and outputs a document for each state.\n\n\nReturn Largest and Smallest Cities by State\nReturn Largest and Smallest Cities by State\nThe following aggregation operation returns the smallest and largest cities by population for each state:\ndb.zipcodes.aggregate([\n   { $group:\n      {\n        _id: { state: \"$state\", city: \"$city\" },\n        pop: { $sum: \"$pop\" }\n      }\n   },\n   { $sort: { pop: 1 } },\n   { $group:\n      {\n        _id : \"$_id.state\",\n        biggestCity:  { $last: \"$_id.city\" },\n        biggestPop:   { $last: \"$pop\" },\n        smallestCity: { $first: \"$_id.city\" },\n        smallestPop:  { $first: \"$pop\" }\n      }\n   },\n\n  // the following $project is optional, and\n  // modifies the output format.\n\n  { $project:\n    { _id: 0,\n      state: \"$_id\",\n      biggestCity:  { name: \"$biggestCity\",  pop: \"$biggestPop\" },\n      smallestCity: { name: \"$smallestCity\", pop: \"$smallestPop\" }\n    }\n  }\n])\n\nHere is a screenshot with the results from the aggregate query:\n\n\nIn this example, the aggregation pipeline consists of a $group stage, a $sort stage, another $group stage, and a $project stage:\n\n\nThe first $group stage groups the documents by the combination of the city and state, calculates the sum of the pop values for each combination, and outputs a document for each city and state combination.\n\nThe $sort stage orders the documents in the pipeline by the pop field value, from smallest to largest; i.e. by increasing order. This operation does not alter the documents.\n\nThe next $group stage groups the now-sorted documents by the _id.state field (i.e. the state field inside the _id document) and outputs a document for each state. The stage also calculates the following four fields for each state. Using the $last expression, the $group operator creates the biggestCity and biggestPop fields that store the city with the largest population and that population. Using the $first expression, the $group operator creates the smallestCity and smallestPop fields that store the city with the smallest population and that population.\n\nThe final $project stage renames the _id field to state and moves the biggestCity, biggestPop, smallestCity, and smallestPop into biggestCity and smallestCity embedded documents.\n\n\nUser Preference Data\nAll of this comes from official docs at Aggregation with user preference data\nLet us create a user preference collection using the following script in the workshop:\nmongo scripts/create-userprefs-collection.js\n\nNow we can run the following aggregate query in MongoDB:\ndb.userstats.aggregate([     \n    { $project: { name: { $concat: [ { $toUpper: \"$firstName\" }, \" \", { $toUpper: \"$lastName\" }]}} },       \n    { $sort : { name : 1 } } \n])\n\nHere is the aggregation query request which concatenates the firstName and lastName fields and transforms them into uppercase onto a new field called name and sort by the name field\n\nAll documents from the users collection pass through the pipeline, which consists of the following operations:\n\nThe $project operator:\n\ncreates a new field called name.\nconverts the value of the _id to upper case, with the $toUpper operator. Then the $project creates a new field, named name to hold this value.\nsuppresses the id field. $project will pass the _id field by default, unless explicitly suppressed.\n\n\nThe $sort operator orders the results by the name field.\n\n\nReturn Usernames Ordered by Join Month\nReturn Usernames Ordered by Join Month\n\nThe following aggregation operation returns user names sorted by the month they joined. This kind of aggregation could help generate membership renewal notices.\n\n\nNotice here that we added a field called month_joined using $project\nThe pipeline passes all documents in the users collection through the following operations:\n\nThe $project operator:\n\nCreates two new fields: month_joined and name.\nSuppresses the id from the results. The aggregate() method includes the _id, unless explicitly suppressed.\n\n\nThe $month operator converts the values of the joined field to integer representations of the month. \n\nThen the $project operator assigns those values to the month_joined field.\n\n\nThe $sort operator sorts the results by the month_joined field.\n\n\nReturn Total Number of Joins per Month\nReturn Total Number of Joins per Month\n\nThe following operation shows how many people joined each month of the year. You might use this aggregated data for recruiting and marketing strategies.\n\n\nThe pipeline passes all documents in the users collection through the following operations:\n\nThe $project operator creates a new field called month_joined.\n\nThe $month operator converts the values of the joined field to integer representations of the month. Then the $project operator assigns the values to the month_joined field.\n\nThe $group operator collects all documents with a given month_joined value and counts how many documents there are for that value. Specifically, for each unique value, $group creates a new “per-month” document with two fields:\n\n_id, which contains a nested document with the month_joined field and its value.\nnumber, which is a generated field. The $sum operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing the given month_joined value.\n\n\nThe $sort operator sorts the documents created by $group according to the contents of the month_joined field.\n\n\nReturn the Five Most Common \"Likes\"\n\nThe following aggregation collects top five most \"liked\" activities in the data set. This type of analysis could help inform planning and future development.\n\n\nThe pipeline begins with all documents in the users collection, and passes these documents through the following operations:\n\nThe $unwind operator separates each value in the likes array, and creates a new version of the source document for every element in the array.\n\nThe $group operator collects all documents with the same value for the likes field and counts each grouping. With this information, $group creates a new document with two fields:\n\n_id, which contains the likes value.\nnumber, which is a generated field. The $sum operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing the given likes value.\n\n\nThe $sort operator sorts these documents by the number field in reverse order.\n\nThe $limit operator only includes the first 5 result documents.\n\n\nSingle Purpose Aggregation Operations\n\nMongoDB also provides db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount(), db.collection.count() and db.collection.distinct().\nAll of these operations aggregate documents from a single collection. While these operations provide simple access to common aggregation processes, they lack the flexibility and capabilities of the aggregation pipeline and map-reduce.\n\nPipeline\nPipeline\n\nThe MongoDB aggregation pipeline consists of stages. Each stage transforms the documents as they pass through the pipeline. Pipeline stages do not need to produce one output document for every input document; e.g., some stages may generate new documents or filter out documents. Pipeline stages can appear multiple times in the pipeline.\n\nPipeline Expressions\nPipeline Expressions\n\nSome pipeline stages take a pipeline expression as the operand. Pipeline expressions specify the transformation to apply to the input documents. Expressions have a document structure and can contain other expression.\nPipeline expressions can only operate on the current document in the pipeline and cannot refer to data from other documents: expression operations provide in-memory transformation of documents.\nGenerally, expressions are stateless and are only evaluated when seen by the aggregation process with one exception: accumulator expressions.\n\nMap-Reduce\n*All of the examples stem from the official docs at Map Reduce Examples\nMap-Reduce\n\nMongoDB also provides map-reduce operations to perform aggregation. In general, map-reduce operations have two phases: a map stage that processes each document and emits one or more objects for each input document, and reduce phase that combines the output of the map operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a finalize stage to make final modifications to the result. Like other aggregation operations, map-reduce can specify a query condition to select the input documents as well as sort and limit the results.\nMap-reduce uses custom JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce operations, as well as the optional finalize operation. While the custom JavaScript provide great flexibility compared to the aggregation pipeline, in general, map-reduce is less efficient and more complex than the aggregation pipeline.\nMap-reduce can operate on a sharded collection. Map-reduce operations can also output to a sharded collection. See Aggregation Pipeline and Sharded Collections and Map-Reduce and Sharded Collections for details.\nMap-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing large volumes of data into useful aggregated results. For map-reduce operations, MongoDB provides the mapReduce database command.\n\nLet us create a collection called ordersv2 with the following mongo script:\nmongo scripts/create-ordersv2-collection.js\n\nReturn the Total Price Per Customer\nReturn the Total Price Per Customer\nLet us run the following query to return the total price per customer:\n\"use strict\";\n\nlet db = connect(\"localhost:27017/nosql_workshop\");\n\nlet mapFunc = function() {\n    emit(this.cust_id, this.price);\n};\n\nlet reduceFunc = function(keyCustId, valuesPrices) {\n    return Array.sum(valuesPrices);\n};\n\ndb.ordersv2.mapReduce(\n    mapFunc,\n    reduceFunc,\n    { out: \"map_reduce_example\" }\n);\n\nWe can run this query and create a new collection called \"map_reduce_example\" with the following command:\nmongo scripts/map-reduce-total-price-per-customer.js\n\nCalculate Order and Total Quantity with Average Quantity Per Item\nCalculate Order and Total Quantity with Average Quantity Per Item\nHere is the corresponding example mongo script:\n\"use strict\";\n\nlet db = connect(\"localhost:27017/nosql_workshop\");\n\nlet mapFunc = function() {\n    this.items.forEach(function(item) {\n        var value = {\n            count: 1,\n            qty: item.qty\n        };\n        emit(item.sku, value);\n    });\n};\n\nlet reduceFunc = function(keyCustId, countObjVals) {\n    let reducedVal = {\n        count: 0,\n        qty: 0\n    };\n\n    for (let index = 0; index \nYou can run this example with:\nmongo scripts/calculate_order_and_total_quantity_with_average_quantity_per_item.js\n\nPerform incremental map reduce example\nLet us create a new collection based on the example on Perform Incremental Map Reduce in MongoDB docs\nPlease run the following script to create the sessions collection:\nmongo scripts/create-sessions-collection.js\n\nLet us look at the following example that computes map reduce with sessions collection:\n\"use strict\";\n\nlet db = connect(\"localhost:27017/nosql_workshop\");\n\nlet mapFunc = function() {\n    let key = this.userid;\n    let value = {\n        user_id: this.user_id,\n        total_time: this.length,\n        count: 1,\n        avg_time: 0\n    };\n    emit(key, value);\n};\n\nlet reduceFunc = function(key, values) {\n    let reducedObject = {\n        user_id: key,\n        total_time: 0,\n        count: 0,\n        avg_time: 0\n    };\n\n    for (let i = 0; i  0) {\n        reducedVal.avg_time = reducedVal.total_time / reducedVal.count;\n    }\n\n    return reducedVal;\n}\n\nlet query = {\n    out: \"session_stat\",\n    finalize: finalizeFunc\n};\n\ndb.sessions.mapReduce(\n    mapFunc,\n    reduceFunc,\n    query\n);\n\nLet us say at the end of the day the following entries are added to the sessions collection:\ndb.sessions.insertMany([\n    { user_id: \"9cc42fe7-832b-492c-812b-08663f559ad9\", ts: ISODate(\"2018-11-18T19:59:40.130Z\"), length: 47 },\n    { user_id: \"868e6fd4-e962-48ae-b286-7e358a7f765d\", ts: ISODate(\"2018-09-26T11:00:19.750Z\"), length: 84 },\n    { user_id: \"e52559ad-773e-4c45-84d5-d712e6a86c71\", ts: ISODate(\"2019-01-11T14:04:14.295Z\"), length: 48 },\n    { user_id: \"b3b75da6-68ce-4b14-8841-363ac286ac8e\", ts: ISODate(\"2019-03-08T16:24:18.058Z\"), length: 32 },\n    { user_id: \"fb540a5a-ac56-4557-804e-e8226db05dba\", ts: ISODate(\"2018-12-04T17:02:30.487Z\"), length: 31 },\n    { user_id: \"2084d803-ae55-4b59-b7ef-9ad1b2339a2a\", ts: ISODate(\"2019-01-09T06:54:58.016Z\"), length: 61 }\n])\n\n\nAt the end of the day, perform incremental map-reduce on the sessions collection, but use the query field to select only the new documents. Output the results to the collection session_stat, but reduce the contents with the results of the incremental map-reduce:\n\nNow our query would look like this for the end of day computation:\nlet query = {\n    out: {\n        reduce: \"session_stat\"\n    },\n    query: {\n        ts: {\n            $gt: ISODate('2011-11-05 00:00:00')\n        }\n    },\n    finalize: finalizeFunc\n};\n\nLook at scripts/incremental_map_reducev2.js for more details.\nTroubleshoot the Map Function\nTroubleshoot the Map Function\n\nThe map function is a JavaScript function that associates or \"maps\" a value with a key and emits the key and value pair during a map-reduce operation.\n\nLook at us look the following example to troubleshoot map function:\n\"use strict\";\n\nlet db = connect(\"localhost:27017/nosql_workshop\");\n\nlet map = function() {\n    emit(this.cust_id, this.price);\n};\n\nlet emit = function(key, value) {\n    print(\"emit\");\n    print(`key: ${key} value: ${tojson(value)}`);\n\n};\n\nlet myDoc = db.ordersv2.findOne({ price: { $gt: 300 } });\nmap.apply(myDoc);\n\n// Now invoke map with multiple documents\nlet myCursor = db.ordersv2.find({ price: { $gt: 300 } });\n\nwhile (myCursor.hasNext()) {\n    let doc = myCursor.next();\n    print(`document _id = ${tojson(doc._id)}`);\n    map.apply(doc);\n    print();\n}\n\nTroubleshoot the Reduce Function\n\nThe reduce function is a JavaScript function that \"reduces\" to a single object all the values associated with a particular key during a map-reduce operation. The reduce function must meet various requirements. This tutorial helps verify that the reduce function meets the following criteria:\n\nLook at the following script that uses the examples from Troubleshoot reduce function.\nAggregation Reference\n\nAggregation Quick Reference\n\nAggregation Commands\n\nAggregation Commands Comparison\n\nAggregation Variables\n\nSQL to Aggregation Mapping Chart\n\n\nAggregation Quick Reference\nAll information here is directly from official MongoDB docs at Aggregation Pipeline Quick Reference\nAggregation Stages Table Reference for db.collection.aggregate\n\n\n\n\nAggregation Stage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n$addFields\nAdds new fields to documents.

When designing data models, always consider the application usage of the data (i.e. queries, updates, and processing of the data) as well as the inherent structure of the data itself.\n\nFlexible Schema\n\nUnlike SQL databases, where you must determine and declare a table’s schema before inserting data, MongoDB’s collections, by default, does not require its documents to have the same schema. That is:\nThe documents in a single collection do not need to have the same set of fields and the data type for a field can differ across documents within a collection.\nTo change the structure of the documents in a collection, such as add new fields, remove existing fields, or change the field values to a new type, update the documents to the new structure.\nThis flexibility facilitates the mapping of documents to an entity or an object. Each document can match the data fields of the represented entity, even if the document has substantial variation from other documents in the collection.\nIn practice, however, the documents in a collection share a similar structure, and you can enforce document validation rules for a collection during update and insert operations. See Schema Validation for details.\n\nDocument Structure\n\nThe key decision in designing data models for MongoDB applications revolves around the structure of documents and how the application represents relationships between data. MongoDB allows related data to be embedded within a single document.\n\nEmbedded Data\n\nEmbedded documents capture relationships between data by storing related data in a single document structure. MongoDB documents make it possible to embed document structures in a field or array within a document. These denormalized data models allow applications to retrieve and manipulate related data in a single database operation.\n\nReferences\nReferences store the relationships between data by including links or references from one document to another. Applications can resolve these references to access the related data. Broadly, these are normalized data models.\nuser document:\n{\n    _id: ObjectId(\"12345\"),\n    username: \"jbelmont\"\n}\n\ncontact document:\n{\n    id: ObjectId(\"some1345\"),\n    user_id: ObjectId(\"12345\"),\n    phone: \"910-923-4556\",\n    email: \"somebody@hey.com\"\n}\n\nNotice here that user_id is a reference to the _id field in the user document.\nSchema Validation\nSchema Validation\n\nMongoDB provides the capability to perform schema validation during updates and insertions in version 3.2\n\nSpecify Validation Rules\nValidation rules are on a per-collection basis.\nTo specify validation rules when creating a new collection, use db.createCollection() with the validator option.\nTo add document validation to an existing collection, use collMod command with the validator option.\nMongoDB also provides the following related options:\n\nvalidationLevel option, which determines how strictly MongoDB applies validation rules to existing documents during an update, and\n\nvalidationAction option, which determines whether MongoDB should error and reject documents that violate the validation rules or warn about the violations in the log but allow invalid documents.\n\n\nJSON Schema\n\nStarting in version 3.6, MongoDB supports JSON Schema validation. To specify JSON Schema validation, use the $jsonSchema operator in your validator expression.\n\nJSON Schema is the recommended means of performing schema validation.\nSchema validation with json schema:\ndb.createCollection(\"students\", {\n   validator: {\n      $jsonSchema: {\n         bsonType: \"object\",\n         required: [ \"name\", \"year\", \"major\", \"gpa\", \"address.city\", \"address.street\" ],\n         properties: {\n            name: {\n               bsonType: \"string\",\n               description: \"must be a string and is required\"\n            },\n            gender: {\n               bsonType: \"string\",\n               description: \"must be a string and is not required\"\n            },\n            year: {\n               bsonType: \"int\",\n               minimum: 2017,\n               maximum: 3017,\n               exclusiveMaximum: false,\n               description: \"must be an integer in [ 2017, 3017 ] and is required\"\n            },\n            major: {\n               enum: [ \"Math\", \"English\", \"Computer Science\", \"History\", null ],\n               description: \"can only be one of the enum values and is required\"\n            },\n            gpa: {\n               bsonType: [ \"double\" ],\n               minimum: 0,\n               description: \"must be a double and is required\"\n            },\n            \"address.city\" : {\n               bsonType: \"string\",\n               description: \"must be a string and is required\"\n            },\n            \"address.street\" : {\n               bsonType: \"string\",\n               description: \"must be a string and is required\"\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n})\n\nNotice here that we specify the bson type for each property and can specify required fields.\nQuery Expressions\n\nIn addition to JSON Schema validation, MongoDB supports validation with query filter expressions using the query operators, with the exception of $near, $nearSphere, $text, and $where.\n\ndb.createCollection( \"contacts\", { \n    validator: { \n        $or: [\n            { phone: { $type: \"string\" } },\n            { email: { $regex: /@mongodb\\.com$/ } },\n            { status: { $in: [ \"Unknown\", \"Incomplete\" ] } }\n        ]\n    }\n})\n\nLet us try to add a new set of contacts with the validation rules that fail in the following example:\ndb.contacts.insert([\n   { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"Anne\", \"phone\": \"+1 555 123 456\", \"city\": \"London\", \"status\": \"Complete\" },\n   { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"Ivan\", \"city\": \"Vancouver\" }\n])\n\n\nLet us fix the validation failures in the example:\ndb.contacts.insert([\n   { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"Anne\", \"phone\": \"+1 555 123 456\", \"city\": \"London\", \"status\": \"Incomplete\" },\n   { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"Ivan\", \"city\": \"Vancouver\", \"email\": \"somebody@mongodb.com\" }\n])\n\n\nNotice that it passed now because the $or validation passed for the status which is Incomplete in _id 1 and we passed a valid email to the _id of 2.\nExisting Documents\nExisting Documents\nThe validationLevel option determines which operations MongoDB applies the validation rules:\n\nIf the validationLevel is strict (the default), MongoDB applies validation rules to all inserts and updates.\n\nIf the validationLevel is moderate, MongoDB applies validation rules to inserts and to updates to existing documents that already fulfill the validation criteria. With the moderate level, updates to existing documents that do not fulfill the validation criteria are not checked for validity.\n\n\nLet us create a new collection called \"contacts2\" to test the existing documents validation.\ndb.createCollection(\"contacts2\")\n\ndb.contacts2.insert([\n   { \"_id\": 1, \"name\": \"Anne\", \"phone\": \"+1 555 123 456\", \"city\": \"London\", \"status\": \"Complete\" },\n   { \"_id\": 2, \"name\": \"Ivan\", \"city\": \"Vancouver\" }\n])\n\nLet us now add a validator to the contacts2 collection like this:\ndb.runCommand( {\n   collMod: \"contacts2\",\n   validator: { \n       $jsonSchema: {\n            bsonType: \"object\",\n            required: [ \"phone\", \"name\" ],\n            properties: {\n                phone: {\n                    bsonType: \"string\",\n                    description: \"must be a string and is required\"\n                },\n                name: {\n                    bsonType: \"string\",\n                    description: \"must be a string and is required\"\n                }\n            }\n        } \n   },\n   validationLevel: \"error\"\n})\n\nNow when we try to update the existing contact2 collection we should get a validation failure with an insert like this:\n\nAccept or Reject Invalid Documents\nAccept or Reject Invalid Documents\nThe validationAction option determines how MongoDB handles documents that violate the validation rules:\n\nIf the validationAction is error (the default), MongoDB rejects any insert or update that violates the validation criteria.\n\nIf the validationAction is warn, MongoDB logs any violations but allows the insertion or update to proceed.\n\n\ndb.createCollection( \"contacts2\", {\n   validator: { $jsonSchema: {\n      bsonType: \"object\",\n      required: [ \"phone\" ],\n      properties: {\n         phone: {\n            bsonType: \"string\",\n            description: \"must be a string and is required\"\n         },\n         email: {\n            bsonType : \"string\",\n            pattern : \"@mongodb\\.com$\",\n            description: \"must be a string and match the regular expression pattern\"\n         },\n         status: {\n            enum: [ \"Unknown\", \"Incomplete\" ],\n            description: \"can only be one of the enum values\"\n         }\n      }\n   } },\n   validationAction: \"warn\"\n} )\n\n\n\nNotice that the log showed the warning but the insert still occurred.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← MongoDB Aggregation\nMongoDB Data Models Part I →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/mongodb_data_models_part_II.html":{"url":"docs/mongodb_data_models_part_II.html","title":"MongoDB Data Models Part II","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop - Mongo Data Models\nSections:\n\nData Modeling Concepts\nData Model Examples and Patterns\nData Model Reference\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nAll of this information is from Data Modeling Part II\nData Modeling Concepts\nData Model Design\n\nWith MongoDB, you may embed related data in a single structure or document. These schema are generally known as “denormalized” models, and take advantage of MongoDB’s rich documents. Consider the following diagram:\n\nuser document:\n{\n    _id: ObjectId(\"12345\"),\n    username: \"jbelmont\",\n    contact: {\n      phone: \"910-923-4556\",\n      email: \"somebody@hey.com\"\n    },\n    access: {\n      level: 5,\n      group: \"dev\"\n    }\n}\n\nNotice that the user document has 2 embedded documents: contact and access respectively.\ncontact document:\n{\n    id: ObjectId(\"some1345\"),\n    phone: \"910-923-4556\",\n    email: \"somebody@hey.com\"\n}\n\naccess document:\n{\n   id: ObjectId(\"some1345\"),\n   level: 5,\n   group: \"dev\"\n}\n\n\nEmbedded data models allow applications to store related pieces of information in the same database record. As a result, applications may need to issue fewer queries and updates to complete common operations.\nIn general, use embedded data models when:\n\n\nyou have \"contains\" relationships between entities.\n\nyou have one-to-many relationships between entities. In these relationships the \"many\" or child documents always appear with or are viewed in the context of the \"one\" or parent documents. See Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents.\nIn general, embedding provides better performance for read operations, as well as the ability to request and retrieve related data in a single database operation. Embedded data models make it possible to update related data in a single atomic write operation.\n\nTo access data within embedded documents, use dot notation to \"reach into\" the embedded documents. See query for data in arrays and query data in embedded documents for more examples on accessing data in arrays and embedded documents.\n\n\nNormalized Data Models\nuser document:\n{\n    _id: ObjectId(\"12345\"),\n    username: \"jbelmont\"\n}\n\ncontact document:\n{\n    id: ObjectId(\"some1345\"),\n    user_id: ObjectId(\"12345\"),\n    phone: \"910-923-4556\",\n    email: \"somebody@hey.com\"\n}\n\n{\n   id: ObjectId(\"some1345\"),\n   user_id: ObjectId(\"12345\"),\n   level: 5,\n   group: \"dev\"\n}\n\n\nIn general, use normalized data models:\n\nwhen embedding would result in duplication of data but would not provide sufficient read performance advantages to outweigh the implications of the duplication.\nto represent more complex many-to-many relationships.\nto model large hierarchical data sets.\nReferences provides more flexibility than embedding. However, client-side applications must issue follow-up queries to resolve the references. In other words, normalized data models can require more round trips to the server.\n\n\nData Model Examples and Patterns\nModel One-to-One Relationships with Embedded Documents\nModel One-to-One Relationships with Embedded Documents¶\n\nConsider the following example that maps patron and address relationships. The example illustrates the advantage of embedding over referencing if you need to view one data entity in context of the other. In this one-to-one relationship between patron and address data, the address belongs to the patron.\nIn the normalized data model, the address document contains a reference to the patron document.\n\n// address doc\n{\n   _id: \"joe\",\n   name: \"Joe Bookreader\"\n}\n\n// patron doc\n{\n   patron_id: \"joe\",\n   street: \"123 Fake Street\",\n   city: \"Faketon\",\n   state: \"MA\",\n   zip: \"12345\"\n}\n\n\nIf the address data is frequently retrieved with the name information, then with referencing, your application needs to issue multiple queries to resolve the reference. The better data model would be to embed the address data in the patron data, as in the following document:\n\n// In here address document information is embedded into patron document.\n{\n   _id: \"joe\",\n   name: \"Joe Bookreader\",\n   address: {\n              street: \"123 Fake Street\",\n              city: \"Faketon\",\n              state: \"MA\",\n              zip: \"12345\"\n            }\n}\n\n\nWith the embedded data model, your application can retrieve the complete patron information with one query.\n\nModel One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents\nModel One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents\n\nConsider the following example that maps patron and multiple address relationships. The example illustrates the advantage of embedding over referencing if you need to view many data entities in context of another. In this one-to-many relationship between patron and address data, the patron has multiple address entities.\nIn the normalized data model, the address documents contain a reference to the patron document.\n\n// It is normalized since patron_id is a reference to the patron document that you would fetch.\n{\n   _id: \"joe\",\n   name: \"Joe Bookreader\"\n}\n\n{\n   patron_id: \"joe\",\n   street: \"123 Fake Street\",\n   city: \"Faketon\",\n   state: \"MA\",\n   zip: \"12345\"\n}\n\n{\n   patron_id: \"joe\",\n   street: \"1 Some Other Street\",\n   city: \"Boston\",\n   state: \"MA\",\n   zip: \"12345\"\n}\n\n\nIf your application frequently retrieves the address data with the name information, then your application needs to issue multiple queries to resolve the references. A more optimal schema would be to embed the address data entities in the patron data, as in the following document:\n\n{\n   _id: \"joe\",\n   name: \"Joe Bookreader\",\n   addresses: [\n      {\n         street: \"123 Fake Street\",\n         city: \"Faketon\",\n         state: \"MA\",\n         zip: \"12345\"\n      },\n      {\n         street: \"1 Some Other Street\",\n         city: \"Boston\",\n         state: \"MA\",\n         zip: \"12345\"\n      }\n   ]\n }\n\n\nWith the embedded data model, your application can retrieve the complete patron information with one query.\n\nModel One-to-Many Relationships with Document References\nModel One-to-Many Relationships with Document References\n\nConsider the following example that maps publisher and book relationships. The example illustrates the advantage of referencing over embedding to avoid repetition of the publisher information.\nEmbedding the publisher document inside the book document would lead to repetition of the publisher data, as the following documents show:\n\n{\n   title: \"MongoDB: The Definitive Guide\",\n   author: [ \"Kristina Chodorow\", \"Mike Dirolf\" ],\n   published_date: ISODate(\"2010-09-24\"),\n   pages: 216,\n   language: \"English\",\n   // duplicate embedded document\n   publisher: {\n      name: \"O'Reilly Media\",\n      founded: 1980,\n      location: \"CA\"\n   }\n}\n\n{\n   title: \"50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer\",\n   author: \"Kristina Chodorow\",\n   published_date: ISODate(\"2011-05-06\"),\n   pages: 68,\n   language: \"English\",\n   // duplicate embedded document\n   publisher: {\n      name: \"O'Reilly Media\",\n      founded: 1980,\n      location: \"CA\"\n   }\n}\n\n\nTo avoid repetition of the publisher data, use references and keep the publisher information in a separate collection from the book collection.\nWhen using references, the growth of the relationships determine where to store the reference. If the number of books per publisher is small with limited growth, storing the book reference inside the publisher document may sometimes be useful. Otherwise, if the number of books per publisher is unbounded, this data model would lead to mutable, growing arrays, as in the following example:\n\n{\n   name: \"O'Reilly Media\",\n   founded: 1980,\n   location: \"CA\",\n   books: [123456789, 234567890, ...]\n\n}\n\n{\n    _id: 123456789,\n    title: \"MongoDB: The Definitive Guide\",\n    author: [ \"Kristina Chodorow\", \"Mike Dirolf\" ],\n    published_date: ISODate(\"2010-09-24\"),\n    pages: 216,\n    language: \"English\"\n}\n\n{\n   _id: 234567890,\n   title: \"50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer\",\n   author: \"Kristina Chodorow\",\n   published_date: ISODate(\"2011-05-06\"),\n   pages: 68,\n   language: \"English\"\n}\n\n\nTo avoid mutable, growing arrays, store the publisher reference inside the book document:\n\n{\n   _id: \"oreilly\",\n   name: \"O'Reilly Media\",\n   founded: 1980,\n   location: \"CA\"\n}\n\n{\n   _id: 123456789,\n   title: \"MongoDB: The Definitive Guide\",\n   author: [ \"Kristina Chodorow\", \"Mike Dirolf\" ],\n   published_date: ISODate(\"2010-09-24\"),\n   pages: 216,\n   language: \"English\",\n   publisher_id: \"oreilly\"\n}\n\n{\n   _id: 234567890,\n   title: \"50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer\",\n   author: \"Kristina Chodorow\",\n   published_date: ISODate(\"2011-05-06\"),\n   pages: 68,\n   language: \"English\",\n   publisher_id: \"oreilly\"\n}\n\nNotice that we use the name of the publisher here \"oreilly\"\nMongoDB Data Models Tree Structures\nPlease read the official docs on MongoDB Data Models Tree Structures\nData Model Reference\nPlease read the official docs for Data Model References\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← MongoDB Data Models Part I\nMongoDB Transactions →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/mongodb_transactions.html":{"url":"docs/mongodb_transactions.html","title":"MongoDB Transactions","keywords":"","body":"NoSQL Workshop -

By default, all collections have an index on the _id field, and applications and users may add additional indexes to support important queries and operations.\nThe following operation creates an ascending index on the score field of the records collection:\n\ndb.records.createIndex( { score: 1 } )\n\n\nThe value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of 1 specifies an index that orders items in ascending order. A value of -1 specifies an index that orders items in descending order. For additional index types, see index types.\n\nCreate an Index on an Embedded Field\nCreate an Index on an Embedded Field\n\nYou can create indexes on fields within embedded documents, just as you can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields differ from indexes on embedded documents, which include the full content up to the maximum index size of the embedded document in the index. Instead, indexes on embedded fields allow you to use a “dot notation,” to introspect into embedded documents.\n\ndb.records.createIndex( { \"location.state\": 1 } )\n\n\nThe created index will support queries that select on the field location.state, such as the following:\n\n\nCreate an Index on Embedded Document\nCreate an Index on Embedded Document\n\nYou can also create indexes on embedded document as a whole.\nThe location field is an embedded document, containing the embedded fields city and state. The following command creates an index on the location field as a whole:\n\ndb.records.createIndex( { location: 1 } )\n\nCompound Indexes\n\nMongoDB supports compound indexes, where a single index structure holds references to multiple fields within a collection’s documents. The following diagram illustrates an example of a compound index on two fields:\nCompound indexes can support queries that match on multiple fields.\n\nCreate a Compound Index\ndb.collection.createIndex( { : , : , ... } )\n\n\nThe value of the field in the index specification describes the kind of index for that field. For example, a value of 1 specifies an index that orders items in ascending order. A value of -1 specifies an index that orders items in descending order. For additional index types, see index types.\n\nLet us insert many documents to the products collection:\nlet products = [\n  {\"item\":\"Intelligent Granite
